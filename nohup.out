Video script generative AI from Layman's point ofview let's try to understand in thisvideo we are going to understand thebasics of generative AI then I am goingto explain the formal definition ofgenerative AI then we are going tounderstand how generative AI isdifferent from traditional machinelearning and deep learningI am going to cover some majorcategories of gen Ai and I am going totouch upon llm in that context that islarge language models and I am going tocover usage of generative Ai and we willdiscuss some of the next topics that wecan cover as part of this series basedon your interest okayso first of all guys let's start aboutbasics of generative AI what isgenerative AI so going back to the rootof artificial intelligence right so if Iask you what is artificial intelligenceso you have to just give me answer ofwhat is AI as a wholeAI is nothing but just in three words Iwill say you making computersintelligent okay makingcomputersintelligent so this I ask in all myclasses normally are computersintelligent people will say yes and nobut normally computers are notintelligent if you do anything thatmakes systems intelligent everythingcomes Under the Umbrella of AI so thisred thing that you see here is AI okaynow I can make system intelligent bydoing n number of things out of those nnumber of things one thing is known asmachine learning okay so this box thatyou can see here is machine learning nowif I ask you what is machine learningthe simple definition will be we try tolearn the patterns and predict thefuture Behavior so we try to learn thepast patterns past attributes try topredict what will happen in the futurethat is about machine learning then youwould have heard of something known asdeep learning okayso let me go inside machine learning anddraw one more box like this what is deeplearningyou know in deep learning also we try tolearn the pattern or behavior from thepast data and predict the future but ina specific way so that way is calledneural network way or neuron way orwhatever you call it but a sub field ofmachine learning a specific area ofmachine learning okay and inside deeplearning inside deep learning becausegenerative AI uses in all itsapplication deep learning methodology soI will put it here inside and I willcall thisI will put it here inside in green colorand I will call this generative AI okayso generative AI normally uses deeplearning Concepts deep learningmethodology deep learning ways hence Iam putting it inside the Deep learningbox so what is generative AI basicallyso guys what is the definition of normalmachine learning or deep learningI will simply write it herea system okay a system2 and here I can write three things okayI can write here three things what arethose three things please pay attentionhere predictpredict or classifyokay predict or classify or clusterokay predict or classify or clusterbarring few algorithms likerecommendation engines or some of thespecific algorithm if we keep aside mostof the algorithm will do these threethings they will either predict or theywill classify or they will cluster thisis your typical machine learning anddeep learning okay so I will write hereml plus DL will do these thingswhat will generative AI do is I willwrite here generative AI okayyou can write here a system toa system toand this keyword is extremely importantand Crux of the definition guides thisis the formal definition of what youcalled as a generative AIin generative AI you do not predict youdo not estimate you do not classify youdo not cluster what you do is generateokay and what is the meaning of thisgeneration we will come to this laterbut for now try to understand this withone more example because this should bevery very clear in your mind howgenerative AI is different fromtraditional machine learning deeplearning or you know AI that we knowtill todaySo In traditional AI if you go and youwant to estimate y right Y is youroutput f is the function through whichyour y relates to input so I will justwrite here what is X x is your inputwhat is y y is your output okay what isf f is the function that you are tryingto estimate okay so in case of yourtraditional machine learning and deeplearning this F will be again I amwriting the same things predictokay or classifyokay or cluster this function f what isthe job of function f either predictclassify or cluster in terms ofgenerative AI what is the job of thisfunction or what this function willlearn this function will run how togenerate now the question comes what togenerate right so generate can be manythings for example it can be a textgenerationit can be a audio generationit can be a video generationit can be a image generation and so onand so forth I will talk about what arethe use cases of generative AI in amoment for now try to understandtraditional deep learning and generativeAI difference okaylet's move ahead and try to understandwhat are the major categories ofgenerative AI so broadly two maincategories of generative AI you willhear and one of the most importantcategory that is lot of you know in newsand everybody knows about that issomething known as large language modelsokay and other categories of gender Tywhich is also very popular generative AIcategory but you know not as popular aslarge language models so this is knownas image basednow what is large language models largelanguage models have certain propertiesthat we need to understand okay so justremember these properties about largelanguage models guys basically this is atextyou know text based normally it istrained on the text Data okay so you cansee here trained on large very verylarge data trend on very large data thisis one property of large language modelsokay second property of large languagemodels is it will be generic in natureso when if you are not able to recollector understand what is large languagemodel think it as chat GPT so every timeyou are interacting with chat GPT youare interacting with a large languagemodelso large language model will normallywhen it is created it is generic it isnot not prepared to serve any specificpurpose so it is it will serve for allthe purposes out there okay you want tobuild a chatbot that is fine for chatbotyou want a question answer system itworks as a question answer system youwant to build a support system it canwork as a support system so it isgeneric in nature when it is built ifyou do not customize it based on yourneeds okay andtrained on trained onmillions and billions of parameter okayso millions of parameter now why I amwriting these things here issuppose you don't have very Hi-Fiinfrastructure right then how would youtrain a model on millions and billionsof parameters so try to understand theseguys this is like millions and billionsof features and parameters if you don'thave a good infrastructure it will bevery difficult for you to train yourmodel hence all the big shots forexample Googleokay for example Google for example metaor Facebook okay for example Microsoftall of these big shots have their ownlarge language models which they havetrained on very large data set and veryhigh infrastructure now it is notpossible for you and me to have thatkind of infrastructure and this kind ofdata set so that we can build our ownlarge language model okay these guyshave built their own large languagemodels and if I if I write the name herecorrectly Google's large language modelname is p-a-l-m okay and Facebook'slarge language model is I thinksomething in the LM in the beginning youcan check so in the beginning it is LMonly and Microsoft's also now chat GPTitself is taken by Microsoft so thatthat part we know already right so allthe big shots are investing in largelanguage model the reason being this canbe used for multi-purpose they have theinfra and they have the lot of data okayhow large language model will be usefulto you I am sure you have used zgpt andyou know the capabilities of chat CPTokayso up to here guys whatever I discussedI discussed from beginner's point ofview and I just wanted to make youunderstand what is this and how it worksokaynow as a data scientist as a dataanalyst or you know somebody who isinterested in going deeper in thesealgorithms it will get very technicaland I will just write here some of theterms thatI can cover if you want me to cover okayone one topic or one natural languageprocessing technique is called encoderdecoder okay encoder decoder is onetechnique that is heavily being used inlarge language models and all kinds ofgenerative AI tools that you seeanother topic that is interestinteresting and that is very much usedin these context is something known asattention mechanism okay attentionmechanismand if you ask me on what these largelanguage models are built so the answerto that will be something known as butand Transformers okayso these are the topics guys which areAdvanced neural network systems okay andif you know the basics of how NN okayhow nn RNN works I'll not say CNNbecause mostly will be talking text Datahere if you know how NN and RNN worksthen you have the base of understandinghow encoder decoder Transformers andattention mechanism will work okay thiswill be very mathematical in nature so Iwill keep it for a separate video but Ineed to see your comment I need to sayyour interest so if you drop me acomment that you know you need videos onthese topics I will definitely createvideos and explain you how in Googleautocomplete right for example if I ifyou go to Google Google Gmail right andyou say I amgoing to then it will automaticallystart suggesting you something rightthat is nothing but a generative AI itis generating textokay it is generating text for youat the moment you go to chat GPT and youwrite what iswhat is world populationwhat is world population rightwhat it gives you it gives you an answerokay so you get an answer using whatusing generative AI large languagemodelsso if you see what are the differenthuge cases of large language modelsright I have written herein textfor writing text for creating yourcontent for example writing blogs foryour support channels you know you wantto build a chatbot system questionanswer system all these things this isnot the end of it few things that cameto my mind I have written here in coderight suppose I want to convert a pythoncode to Java code you can convert thecode you can prepare documentation forthe code you can generate the new codealso you you are you'd have already donein chat GPT I believein image you can generate image you canextract information from image what notyou can do in speech you can generatespeech of some person you can give sometext and generate this speech you canconvert this speech in one form to otherone Tense one language to othertranslate it you can create videos youcan analyze video like in which part ofthe video somebody is laughing somebodyis sad somebody is angry all thoseanalysis you can do in generative AI ingaming industry you can compose musicyou can do animation so there is no endto what can be done in generative AIokaybut the fundamentals from technologypoint of view if you want to understandI'm sure you will be having at leastsome knowledge of deep learning how itworks how neural network works if notyou can watch my neural network seriesyou will get a very good idea on top ofthat we need to learn these three fourthings and then the idea of llm and theidea of genetic AI will be very veryclear for you so let me know throughcomments guys if you like thisintroductory video so that I getmotivated and create more video on thistopic based on your interest okay I'llsee you all in the next video guyswherever you are stay safe and take care

Video script [Music]ever since computers were inventedthey've really just been glorifiedcalculators machines that execute theexact instructions given to them by theprogrammers but something incredible ishappening now computers have startedgaining the ability to learn and thinkand communicate just like we do they cando creative intellectual work thatpreviously only humans could do we callthis technology generative Ai and youmay have encountered it already throughproducts like GPT basically intelligenceis now available as a service kind oflike a giant brain floating in the skythat anyone can talk to it's not perfectbut it is surprisingly capable and it isimproving at an exponential rate this isa big deal it's going to affect justabout every person and Company on theplanet positively or negatively thisvideo is here to help you understandwhat generative AI is all about inPractical terms beyond the hype thebetter you understand this technology asa person team or company the betterequipped you will be to survive andthrive in the age of AI so here's asilly but useful mental model for thisyou have Einstein in your basement infact everyone does and by Einstein Ireally mean the combination of everysmart person who ever lived you can talkto Einstein whenever you want he hasinstant access to the sum of all humanknowledge and will answer anything youwant within seconds never running out ofpatience he can also take on any roleyou want a comedian poet doctor coachand will be an expert within that fieldhe has some human-like limitationsthough he can make mistakes he can jumpto conclusions he can misunderstand youbut the biggest limitation is actuallyyour imagination and your ability tocommunicate effectively with them thisskill is known as prompt engineering andin the age of AI this is as essential asreading and writing most people vastlyunderestimate what this Einstein in yourbasement can do it's like going to thereal Einstein and asking him to proofread a high school report or hiring aworldclass five-star chef and having himchop onion the more you interact withEinstein the more you will discoversurprising and Powerful ways for him tohelp you or your company okay enoughfluffy metaphors let's clarify someterms AI as you probably know stands forartificial intelligence AI is not new FSlike machine learning and computervision have been around for decadeswhenever you see a YouTuberecommendation or a web search result orwhenever you get a credit cardtransaction approved that's traditionalAI in action generative AI is AI thatgenerates new original content ratherthan just finding or classifyingexisting content that's the G in GPT forexample large language models or llmsare a type of generative AI that cancommunicate using normal human languagechat GPT is a product by the companyopen AI it started as an llm essentiallyan advanced chatbot using a newarchitecture called the Transformerarchitecture which by the way is the Tin GPT it is so fluent at human languagethat anyone can use it you don't need tobe an AI expert or programmer and that'skind of what triggered the wholeRevolution so how does it actually workwell a large language model is anartificial neural network basically abunch of numbers or or parametersconnected to each other similar to howour brain is a bunch of neurons or braincells connected to each other neuralnetworks only deal with numbers you sendin numbers and depending on how theparameters are set all the numbers comeout but any kind of content such as textor images can be represented as numbersso let's say I write dogs are when Isend that to a large language model thatgets converted to numbers processed bythe neural network and then theresulting numbers are converted backinto text in this case the word animalsdogs are animals so yeah this isbasically a guest to next word machinethe interesting part is if we take thatoutput and combine it with the input andsend it through the model again then itwill continue adding new words that'swhat's going on behind the scenes whenyou type something in chat GPT in thiscase for example it generated a wholestory and I can continue thisindefinitely by adding moreprompts a large language model may havebillions or even trillions of ofparameters that's why they're calledlarge so how are all these numbers setwell not through manual programming thatwould be impossible but through trainingjust like babies learning to speak ababy isn't told how to speak she doesn'tget an instruction manual instead shelistens to people speaking around herand when she's heard enough she startsseeing the pattern she speaks a fewwords at first to the Delight of herparents and then later on full sentencessimilarly during a training period thelanguage model is fed a mindbogglingamount of text to learn from Mostly frominternet sources it then plays guess thenext word with all of this over and overagain and the parameters areautomatically tweaked until it startsgetting really good at predicting thenext word this is called backpropagation which is a fancy term for ohI guessed wrong I better changesomething however to become truly usefula model also needs to undergo humantraining this is called reinforcementlearning with human feedback and itinvolves thousands of hours of humanspainstakingly testing and evaluatingoutput from the model and givingfeedback kind of like training a a dogwith a clicker to reinforce goodbehavior that's why a model like GPTwon't tell you how to rob a bank itknows very well how to rob a bank butthrough human training it has learnedthat it shouldn't help people commitcrimes when training is done the modelis mostly Frozen other than some finetuning that can happen later that's whatthe P stands for in GPT pre-trainedalthough in the future we will probablyhave models that can learn continuouslyrather than just uh during training andfine-tuning now although chat GPT kindof got the ball rolling GPT isn't theonly model out there in fact new modelsare sprouting likemushrooms they vary a lot in terms ofspeed capability and cost some can bedownloaded and run locally others areonly online some are free or open sourceothers are commercial products some aresuper easy to use While others requirecomplicated technical setup some arespecialized for certain use cases othersare more General and can be used foralmost anything and some are baked intoproducts in the form of co-pilots or orchat windows it's it's the Wild Westjust keep in mind that you generally getwhat you pay for so with a free modelyou may just be getting a smart highschool student in your basement ratherthan Einstein the difference between forexample GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 is massivenote that there are different types ofgenerative AI models that generatedifferent types of content textto textmodels like gpc4 take text as input andgenerate text as output the text can benatural language but it can also bestructured information like code JsonHTML I use this a lot myself to generatecode when programming uh it saves anincredible amount of time and I alsolearn a lot from the code it generatestext to image models will generateimages describe what you want and animage gets generated for you you caneven pick a style image to image modelscan do things like transforming orcombining images and we have image totext models which describe the contentsof a given image and speech to textmodels create voice transcriptions whichis useful for things like uh meetingnotes text Audio models they generatemusic or sounds from a prompt forexample here is some sound generatedfrom The Prompt people talking in abusy okay guys enough stop now thank youand there are even text to video modelsthat generate videos from a promptsooner or later we'll have infinitemovie series that autog generate thenext episode tailored to your tastes asyou're watching kind of scary if youthink about it one Trend now ismultimodal AI products meaning theycombine different models into oneproduct so you can work with text imagesaudio Etc without switching tools thechat GPT mobile app is a good example ofthis just for fun I took a photo of thisroom and I asked where I could hidestuff I kind of like that it mentionedthe stove but warned that that it couldget hot there when I have things tofigure out such as the contents of thisvideo I like to take walks using chatGPT as as a sounding board I start bysaying always respond with the word okayunless I ask you for something that wayit'll just listen and not interruptafter I finish dumping my thoughts I askfor feedback we have some discussion andthen I ask it to summarize and textafterwards I really recommend tryingthis it's it's a really useful way touse tools like this turns out Einsteinisn't stuck in the basement after allyou can take him out for a walkinitially language models were just wordpredictors statistical machines withlimited practical use but as they becamelarger and were trained on more datathey started gaining emergentcapabilities expected capabilities thatsurprised even the developers of thetechnology they could roleplay writepoetry write high quality code discusscompany strategy provide legal andmedical advice coach teach basicallycreative and intellectual things thatonly humans could do previously it turnsout that when a model has seen enoughtext and images it starts to seepatterns and understand higher levelConcepts just like a baby learning tounderstand the world let's take a simpleexample I'll give gpc4 this littledrawing that involves a string a pair ofscissors an egg a pot and a fire whatwill happen if I use the scissors themodel has most likely not been trainedon this exact scenario yet it gave apretty good answer which demonstrates abasic understanding of the nature ofscissors eggs gravity and heat when GPT4 was released I started using it as acoding assistant and I was blown awaywhen prompted effectively it was abetter programmer than anyone I'veworked with same with article writingproduct design Workshop planning andjust about anything I used it for forthe main bottleneck was my promptengineering skills so I decided to makea career shift and focus entirely onlearning and teaching how to make thistechnology useful hence this video nowlet's take a step back and look at theimplications for 300,000 years or so wehomosapiens have been the mostintelligent species on Earth dependingof course on how you define intelligencebut the thing is our intellectualcapabilities aren't really improvingthat much our brains are about the samesize same weight as they've been forthousands of years computers on theother hand have been around for only 80years or so and now with generative AIthey are suddenly capable of speakinghuman languages fluently and carryingout an increasing number of intellectualcreative tasks that previously onlyhumans could do so we are right here atthe Crossing Point where AI is better atsome things and humans are better atsome things but ai's capabilities areimproving at an exponential rate whileours aren't we don't know how long thatexponential Improvement will continue orif it will level off at some point butwe're definitely entering a new worldorder now this isn't the firstRevolution we've experienced we tamedfire we learned how to do agriculture weinvented the printing press steam powerTelegraph these were all revolutionarychanges but they took decades orcenturies to become widespread in the AIRevolution new technology spreadsworldwide almost instantly dealing withthis rate of change is a huge challengefor both individuals andcompanies I've noticed that people andcompanies tend to fall into differentkind of mindset categories when it comesto AI on one side we have denial thebelief that AI cannot do my job or wedon't have time to look into thistechnology this is a dangerous place tobe a common saying is AI might not takeyour job but people using AI will andthis is true for both individuals andcompanies on the other side of the scalewe have panic and despair the beliefthat AI is going to take my job nomatter what AI is going to make mycompany go bankrupt neither of thesemindsets are helpful so I propose amiddle ground a balanced positivemindset AI is going to make me my teammy company insanely productivepersonally with this mindset I feel likeI've gained superpowers I can go fromidea to result in so much shorter time Ican focus more on what I want to achieveand less on the grunt workk of buildingthings and I'm learning a lot faster tooit's like having an awesome Mentor withme at all times this mindset not onlyfeels good but it also equips you forthe future makes you less likely to loseyour job or your company and more likelyto thrive in the age of AI despite alltheuncertainty so one important question isis human role X needed in the age of AIfor example are doctors neededdevelopers lawyers CEOs uh whatever sothis question becomes more and morerelevant as the AI capabilities improvewell some jobs will disappear for surebut for most roles I think we humans arestill needed someone with domainknowledge still needs to decide what toask the AI how to formulate The Promptwhat context needs to be provided andhow to evaluate the result AI modelsaren't perfect they can be absolutelybrilliant sometimes but sometimes alsoterribly stupid they can sometimeshallucinate and provide bogusinformation in a very convincing way sowhen should you trust the AI responsewhen should you double check or do thework yourself what about legalcompliance data security whatinformation can we send to an AI modeland where is that data stored a humanexpert is needed to make these judgmentcalls and compensate for the weaknessesof the AI model so I recommend thinkingof AI as your colleague a genius butalso an oddball with some personalquirks that you need to learn to workwith you need to recognize when yourGenius colleague is drunk as a doctor myAI colleague can help diagnose rarediseases that I didn't even know existedas a lawyer my AI colleague could dolegal research and review contractsallowing me to spend more time with myclient or as a teacher my AI colleaguecould grade tests help generate coursecontent provide individual support tostudents Etc and if you're not sure howit can help you just ask it I work as Xhow can you help me overall I find thatthe combination of human plus AI That'swhere the magic lies it's important todistinguish between the models and theproducts that build on top of them as auser you don't normally interact withthe model directly instead you interactwith a product website or a mobile appwhich in turn talks to the model behindthe scenes products provide a userinterface and add capabilities and datathat aren't part of the model itself forexample the chat gbt product keeps trackof your message history while the GPT 4model itself doesn't have any messagehistory history as a developer you canuse these models to build your own AIpowered products and features forexample let's say you have an e-learningsite you could add a chat bot to answerquestions about the courses or as arecruitment company you might build AIpowered tools to help evaluatecandidates in both these cases yourusers interact with your product andthen your product interacts with themodel this is done via apis orapplication programming interfaces whichallow your code to talk to the model sohere's a simple example of using open AIAPI to talk to GPnot a lot of code needed and here'sanother example of the automaticcandidate evaluation thing I talkedabout it takes a job description and abunch of CVS in a folder and evaluateseach candidate automatically andincidentally the code itself is mostlyAI written as a product developer youcan use AI models kind of like anexternal brain to insert intelligenceinto your product very powerful in orderto use generative AI effectively youneed to get good at prompt engineeringor prompt design as I prefer to call itthis skill is needed both as a user andas a product developer because in bothcases you need to be able to crafteffective prompts that produce usefulresults from an AI model here's anexample let's say I want help planning aworkshop this prompt is unlikely to giveuseful results because no matter howsmart the AI is if it doesn't know thecontext of my workshop it can only givefague high level recommendations thesecond prompt is better now I providedsome context this is normally doneiteratively write a prompt look at theresult add a follow-up prompt to providemore information or edit the originalprompt and rinse and repeat until youget a good result in this third approachI ask it to interview me so instead ofme providing a bunch of context up frontI'm basically saying what do you need toknow in order order to help me and thenit will propose a workshop agenda afterI often combine these two I provide abit of context and then I tell it to askme if it needs any more informationthese are just some examples of promptengineering techniques so overall thebetter you get at prompt engineering thefaster and better results you will getfrom AI there are plenty of coursesbooks videos articles to help you learnthis but the most important thing is isto practice and Learn by doing a niceside effect is that you will becomebetter at communicating in general sinceprompt engineering is really all aboutClarity and effectivecommunication I think the next Frontierfor generative AI is autonomous agentswith tools these are AI powereredsoftware entities that run on their ownrather than just sitting around waitingfor you to prompt them all the time soyou go down to Einstein in your basementand do what a good leader would do for ateam you give him a high level Missionand the tools needed to accomplish itand then open the door and let him outto run his own show withoutmicromanagement the tools could bethings like access to the internetaccess to money ability to send andreceive messages order pizza or whateverfor this prompt engineering becomes evenmore important because your autonomoustool wielding agent can do a lot of goodor a lot of harm depending on how wellyou craft that missionstatement all right let's wrap it uphere are the key things I hope you willremember from this video generative AIis a super useful tool that can helpboth you your team and your company in abig way the better you understand it themore likely it is to be an opportunityrather than a threat generative AI ismore powerful than you think the biggestlimitation is not the technology butyour imagination like what can I do andyour prompt engineering skills how do Ido it prompt engineeringdesign is acrucial skill like all new skills justaccept that you will kind of suck at itat first but you'll improve over timewith deliberate practice so my best tipis experiment make this part of yourday-to-day life and the Learning Happensautomatically

Video script Let me show you something.To be precise,I'm going to show you nothing.This was the world 540 million years ago.Pure, endless darkness.It wasn't dark due to a lack of light.It was dark because of a lack of sight.Although sunshine did filter 1,000 metersbeneath the surface of ocean,a light permeated from hydrothermal
vents to seafloor,brimming with life,there was not a single eye
to be found in these ancient waters.No retinas, no corneas, no lenses.So all this light,
all this life went unseen.There was a time that the very idea
of seeing didn't exist.It [had] simply never been done before.Until it was.So for reasons we're only
beginning to understand,trilobites, the first organisms
that could sense light, emerged.They're the first inhabitants
of this reality that we take for granted.First to discover that there is
something other than oneself.A world of many selves.The ability to see is thought
to have ushered in Cambrian explosion,a period in which a huge
variety of animal speciesentered fossil records.What began as a passive experience,the simple act of letting light in,soon became far more active.The nervous system began to evolve.Sight turning to insight.Seeing became understanding.Understanding led to actions.And all these gave rise to intelligence.Today, we're no longer satisfied with just
nature's gift of visual intelligence.Curiosity urges us to create machines
to see just as intelligently as we can,if not better.Nine years ago, on this stage,I delivered an early progress report
on computer vision,a subfield of artificial intelligence.Three powerful forces
converged for the first time.Aa family of algorithms
called neural networks.Fast, specialized hardware
called graphic processing units,or GPUs.And big data.Like the 15 million images that my lab
spent years curating called ImageNet.Together, they ushered in
the age of modern AI.We've come a long way.Back then, just putting labels on images
was a big breakthrough.But the speed and accuracy
of these algorithms just improved rapidly.The annual ImageNet
challenge, led by my lab,gauged the performance of this progress.And on this plot, you're seeing
the annual improvementand milestone models.We went a step furtherand created algorithms
that can segment objectsor predict the dynamic
relationships among themin these works done by my students
and collaborators.And there's more.Recall last time I showed you
the first computer-vision algorithmthat can describe a photo
in human natural language.That was work done with my brilliant
former student, Andrej Karpathy.At that time, I pushed my luck and said,"Andrej, can we make computers
to do the reverse?"And Andrej said,
"Ha ha, that's impossible."Well, as you can see from this post,recently the impossible
has become possible.That's thanks to a family
of diffusion modelsthat powers today's
generative AI algorithm,which can take human-prompted sentencesand turn them into photos and videosof something that's entirely new.Many of you have seen the recent
impressive results of Sora by OpenAI.But even without the enormous
number of GPUs,my student and our collaboratorshave developed a generative
video model called Waltmonths before Sora.And you're seeing some of these results.There is room for improvement.I mean, look at that cat's eyeand the way it goes under the wave
without ever getting wet.What a cat-astrophe.(Laughter)And if past is prologue,we will learn from these mistakes
and create a future we imagine.And in this future,we want AI to do everything it can for us,or to help us.For years I have been sayingthat taking a picture is not the same
as seeing and understanding.Today, I would like to add to that.Simply seeing is not enough.Seeing is for doing and learning.When we act upon this world
in 3D space and time,we learn, and we learn
to see and do better.Nature has created this virtuous cycle
of seeing and doingpowered by “spatial intelligence.”To illustrate to you what your spatial
intelligence is doing constantly,look at this picture.Raise your hand if you feel
like you want to do something.(Laughter)In the last split of a second,your brain looked
at the geometry of this glass,its place in 3D space,its relationship with the table, the catand everything else.And you can predict
what's going to happen next.The urge to act is innate to all beings
with spatial intelligence,which links perception with action.And if we want to advance AI
beyond its current capabilities,we want more than AI
that can see and talk.We want AI that can do.Indeed, we're making exciting progress.The recent milestones
in spatial intelligenceis teaching computers to see, learn, doand learn to see and do better.This is not easy.It took nature millions of years
to evolve spatial intelligence,which depends on the eye taking light,project 2D images on the retinaand the brain to translate
these data into 3D information.Only recently, a group
of researchers from Googleare able to develop an algorithm
to take a bunch of photosand translate that into 3D space,like the examples we're showing here.My student and our collaborators
have taken a step furtherand created an algorithm
that takes one input imageand turn that into 3D shape.Here are more examples.Recall, we talked about computer programs
that can take a human sentenceand turn it into videos.A group of researchers
in University of Michiganhave figured out a way to translate
that line of sentenceinto 3D room layout, like shown here.And my colleagues at Stanford
and their studentshave developed an algorithm
that takes one imageand generates infinitely plausible spacesfor viewers to explore.These are prototypes of the first
budding signs of a future possibility.One in which the human race
can take our entire worldand translate it into digital formsand model the richness and nuances.What nature did to us implicitly
in our individual minds,spatial intelligence
technology can hope to dofor our collective consciousness.As the progress of spatial
intelligence accelerates,a new era in this virtuous cycle
is taking place in front of our eyes.This back and forth
is catalyzing robotic learning,a key component for any
embodied intelligence systemthat needs to understand
and interact with the 3D world.A decade ago,ImageNet from my labenabled a database of millions
of high-quality photosto help train computers to see.Today, we're doing the same
with behaviors and actionsto train computers and robots
how to act in the 3D world.But instead of collecting static images,we develop simulation environments
powered by 3D spatial modelsso that the computers can have
infinite varieties of possibilitiesto learn to act.And you're just seeing
a small number of examplesto teach our robotsin a project led by my lab
called Behavior.We’re also making exciting progress
in robotic language intelligence.Using large language model-based input,my students and our collaborators
are among the first teamsthat can show a robotic arm
performing a variety of tasksbased on verbal instructions,like opening this drawer
or unplugging a charged phone.Or making sandwiches,
using bread, lettuce, tomatoesand even putting a napkin for the user.Typically I would like
a little more for my sandwich,but this is a good start.(Laughter)In that primordial ocean,
in our ancient times,the ability to see and perceive
one's environmentkicked off the Cambrian explosion
of interactions with other life forms.Today, that light
is reaching the digital minds.Spatial intelligence is allowing machinesto interact not only with one another,but with humans, and with 3D worlds,real or virtual.And as that future is taking shape,it will have a profound
impact to many lives.Let's take health care as an example.For the past decade,my lab has been taking
some of the first stepsin applying AI to tackle challenges
that impact patient outcomeand medical staff burnout.Together with our collaborators
from Stanford School of Medicineand partnering hospitals,we're piloting smart sensorsthat can detect clinicians
going into patient roomswithout properly washing their hands.Or keep track of surgical instruments.Or alert care teams when
a patient is at physical risk,such as falling.We consider these techniques
a form of ambient intelligence,like extra pairs of eyes
that do make a difference.But I would like more interactive help
for our patients, cliniciansand caretakers, who desperately
also need an extra pair of hands.Imagine an autonomous robot
transporting medical supplieswhile caretakers focus on our patientsor augmented reality,
guiding surgeons to do safer, fasterand less invasive operations.Or imagine patients with severe paralysis
controlling robots with their thoughts.That's right, brainwaves,
to perform everyday tasksthat you and I take for granted.You're seeing a glimpse of that future
in this pilot study from my lab recently.In this video, the robotic arm is cooking
a Japanese sukiyaki mealcontrolled only by the brain
electrical signal,non-invasively collected
through an EEG cap.(Applause)Thank you.The emergence of vision
half a billion years agoturned a world of darkness upside down.It set off the most profound
evolutionary process:the development of intelligence
in the animal world.AI's breathtaking progress
in the last decade is just as astounding.But I believe the full potential
of this digital Cambrian explosionwon't be fully realized until we power
our computers and robotswith spatial intelligence,just like what nature did to all of us.It’s an exciting time to teach
our digital companionto learn to reasonand to interact with this beautiful
3D space we call home,and also create many more new worlds
that we can all explore.To realize this future won't be easy.It requires all of us
to take thoughtful stepsand develop technologies
that always put humans in the center.But if we do this right,the computers and robots
powered by spatial intelligencewill not only be useful toolsbut also trusted partnersto enhance and augment
our productivity and humanitywhile respecting our individual dignityand lifting our collective prosperity.What excites me the most in the futureis a future in which that AI
grows more perceptive,insightful and spatially aware,and they join us on our questto always pursue a better way
to make a better world.Thank you.(Applause)

Video script JOHN EWALD: Hello, and
welcome to Introductionto Large Language Models.My name is John Ewald, and
I'm a training developer hereat Google Cloud.In this course, you learn
to define large languagemodels, or LLMs,
describe LLM use cases,explain prompt tuning, and
describe Google's Gen AIdevelopment tools.Large language models, or LLMs,
are a subset of deep learning.To find out more
about deep learning,see our Introduction to
Generative AI course video.LLMs and generative AI
intersect and they areboth a part of deep learning.Another area of AI you
may be hearing a lot aboutis generative AI.This is a type of
artificial intelligence thatcan produce new content,
including text, images, audio,and synthetic data.So what are large
language models?Large language models refer to
large general-purpose languagemodels that can be
pre-trained and then finetuned for specific purposes.What do pre-trained
and fine tuned mean?Imagine training a dog.Often, you train your
dog basic commandssuch as sit, come,
down, and stay.These commands are normally
sufficient for everyday lifeand help your dog become
a good canine citizen.However, if you need a special
service dog such as a policedog, a guide dog, or a hunting
dog, you add special trainings.The similar idea applies
to large language models.These models are trained
for general purposesto solve common language
problems such as textclassification, question
answering, documentsummarization, and text
generation across industries.The models can then be tailored
to solve specific problemsin different fields
such as retail, finance,and entertainment using a
relatively small size of fielddata sets.Let's further break
down the conceptinto three major features
of large language models.Large indicates two meanings.First is the enormous size
of the training data set,sometimes at the petabyte scale.Second, it refers to
the parameter count.In ML, parameters are often
called hyperparameters.Parameters are basically the
memories and the knowledgethat the machine learned
from the model training.Parameters define
the skill of a modelin solving a problem
such as predicting text.General purpose
means that the modelsare sufficient to
solve common problems.Two reasons lead to this idea.First is the commonality of
a human language regardlessof the specific tasks.And second is the
resource restriction.Only certain organizations
have the capabilityto train such large language
models with huge data setsand a tremendous
number of parameters.How about letting them create
fundamental language modelsfor others to use?This leads to the last point,
pre-trained and fine tuned,meaning to pre-train
a large languagemodel for a general purpose
with a large data setand then fine tune it for
specific aims with a muchsmaller data set.The benefits of using
large language modelsare straightforward.First, a single model can
be used for different tasks.This is a dream come true.These large language
models that aretrained with petabytes of
data and generate billionsof parameters are smart enough
to solve different tasks,including language translation,
sentence completion, textclassification, question
answering, and more.Second, large language models
require minimal field trainingdata when you tailor them to
solve your specific problem.Large language models
obtain decent performanceeven with little
domain training data.In other words, they can be
used for few shot or evenzero-shot scenarios.In machine learning,
few shot refersto training a model
with minimal data,and zero shot implies
that a model can recognizethings that have not explicitly
been taught in the trainingbefore.Third, the performance
of large language modelsis continuously growing when you
add more data and parameters.Let's take PaLM as an example.In April 2022,
Google released PaLM,short for Pathways Language
Model, a 540 billion-parametermodel that achieves a state
of the art performanceacross multiple language tasks.PaLM is a dense decoder-only
transformer model.It has 540 billion parameters.It leverages the
new pathways system,which has enabled
Google to efficientlytrain a single model across
multiple TPU V4 pods.Pathway is a new AI
architecture thatwill handle many tasks at
once, learn new tasks quickly,and reflect a better
understanding of the world.The system enables PaLM
to orchestrate distributedcomputation for accelerators.We previously mentioned that
PaLM is a transformer model.A transformer model consists
of encoder and decoder.The encoder encodes
the input sequenceand passes it to
the decoder, whichlearns how to decode
the representationsfor a relevant task.We've come a long away from
traditional programmingto neural networks
to generative models.In traditional
programming, we usedto have to hard code the rules
for distinguishing a cat--type, animal; legs, four;
ears, two; fur, yes;likes yarn, catnip.In the wave of
neural networks, wecould give the network pictures
of cats and dogs and ask,is this a cat?And it would predict a cat.In the generative
wave, we as userscan generate our own content,
whether it be text, images,audio, video, or other.For example, models
like PaLM, or LaMDA,or Language Model for
Dialogue Applications,ingest very, very large
data from multiple sourcesacross the internet and build
foundation language modelswe can use simply by
asking a question,whether typing it into
a prompt or verballytalking into the prompt.So when you ask it
what's a cat, itcan give you everything it
has learned about a cat.Let's compare LLM development
using pre-trained modelswith traditional ML development.First, with LLM development,
you don't need to be an expert.You don't need
training examples.And there is no need
to train a model.All you need to do is think
about prompt design, whichis the process of creating a
prompt that is clear, concise,and informative.It is an important part of
natural language processing.In traditional
machine learning, youneed training examples
to train a model.You also need compute
time and hardware.Let's take a look at an example
of a text generation use case.Question answering, or QA, is
a subfield of natural languageprocessing that deals with the
task of automatically answeringquestions posed in
natural language.QA systems are typically
trained on a large amountof text and code.And they are able to answer
a wide range of questions,including factual, definitional,
and opinion-based questions.The key here is that you
need domain knowledgeto develop these
question-answering models.For example, domain
knowledge is requiredto develop a question-answering
model for customersupport, or health
care, or supply chain.Using generative QA, the
model generates free textdirectly based on the context.There is no need for
domain knowledge.Let's look at three
questions given to Bard,a large language model chat
bot developed by Google AI.Question one."This year's sales are $100,000.Expenses are $60,000.How much is net profit?"Bard first shares how net
profit is calculated, thenperforms the calculation.Then Bard provides the
definition of net profit.Here's another question.Inventory on hand
is 6,000 units.A new order requires
8,000 units.How many units do I need to
fill to complete the order?Again, Bard answers the question
by performing the calculation.And our last example,
we have 1,000 sensorsin 10 geographic regions.How many sensors do we have
on average in each region?Bard answers the
question with an exampleon how to solve the problem
and some additional context.In each of our questions, a
desired response was obtained.This is due to prompt design.Prompt design and
prompt engineeringare two closely-related concepts
in natural language processing.Both involve the
process of creatinga prompt that is clear,
concise, and informative.However, there are some key
differences between the two.Prompt design is the process
of creating a prompt thatis tailored to the specific
task that this system isbeing asked to perform.For example, if
the system is beingasked to translate a text
from English to French,the prompt should be
written in Englishand should specify that
the translation shouldbe in French.Prompt engineering
is the processof creating a prompt
that is designedto improve performance.This may involve using
domain-specific knowledge,providing examples of
the desired output,or using keywords
that are known to beeffective for the
specific system.Prompt design is a
more general concept,while prompt engineering is
a more specialized concept.Prompt design is essential,
while prompt engineeringis only necessary
for systems thatrequire a high degree of
accuracy or performance.There are three kinds of
large language models,generic language models,
instruction tuned,and dialogue tuned.Each needs prompting
in a different way.Generic language models
predict the next wordbased on the language
in the training data.This is an example of a
generic language model.The next word is a token based
on the language in the trainingdata.In this example,
"the cat sat on,"the next word should be "the."And you can see that "the"
is the most likely next word.Think of this type as an
autocomplete in search.In instruction
tuned, the model istrained to predict a
response to the instructionsgiven in the input.For example,
summarize a text of X,generate a poem
in the style of X,give me a list of keywords based
on semantic similarity for X.And in this example,
classify the textinto neutral,
negative, or positive.In dialogue tuned, the model
is trained to have a dialogueby the next response.Dialogue-tuned models
are a special caseof instruction tuned where
requests are typically framedas questions to a chat bot.Dialogue tuning
is expected to bein the context of a longer
back and forth conversation,and typically works better
with natural question-likephrasings.Chain of thought reasoning
is the observationthat models are better at
getting the right answer whenthey first output
text that explainsthe reason for the answer.Let's look at the question.Roger has five tennis balls.He buys two more
cans of tennis balls.Each can has three tennis balls.How many tennis balls
does he have now?This question is posed
initially with no response.The model is less likely to get
the correct answer directly.However, by the time the
second question is asked,the output is more likely to
end with the correct answer.A model that can do everything
has practical limitations.Task-specific tuning can
make LLMs more reliable.Vertex AI provides
task-specific foundation models.Let's say you have
a use case whereyou need to gather
sentiments, or howyour customers are feeling
about your product or service.You can use the
classification tasksentiment analysis task model.Same for vision tasks.If you need to perform
occupancy analytics,there is a task-specific
model for your use case.Tuning a model enables you to
customize the model responsebased on examples
of the task that youwant the model to perform.It is essentially the
process of adapting a modelto a new domain, or set
of custom use cases,by training the
model on new data.For example, we may
collect training dataand tune the model specifically
for the legal or medicaldomain.You can also further tune
the model by fine tuningwhere you bring
your own data setand retrain the model by
tuning every weight in the LLM.This requires a big
training job and hostingyour own fine-tuned model.Here's an example of a medical
foundation model trainedon health care data.The tasks include question
answering, image analysis,finding similar
patients, and so forth.Fine tuning is expensive and
not realistic in many cases.So are there more efficient
methods of tuning?Yes.Parameter-efficient
tuning methods, or PETM,are methods for tuning
a large languagemodel on your own custom data
without duplicating the model.The base model itself
is not altered.Instead, a small
number of add-on layersare tuned, which can be swapped
in and out at inference time.Generative AI Studio lets you
quickly explore and customizegenerative AI
models that you canleverage in your
applications on Google Cloud.Generative AI Studio helps
developers create and deploygenerative AI
models by providinga variety of tools
and resources thatmake it easy to get started.For example, there's a

Video script JOHN EWALD: Hello, and
welcome to Introductionto Large Language Models.My name is John Ewald, and
I'm a training developer hereat Google Cloud.In this course, you learn
to define large languagemodels, or LLMs,
describe LLM use cases,explain prompt tuning, and
describe Google's Gen AIdevelopment tools.Large language models, or LLMs,
are a subset of deep learning.To find out more
about deep learning,see our Introduction to
Generative AI course video.LLMs and generative AI
intersect and they areboth a part of deep learning.Another area of AI you
may be hearing a lot aboutis generative AI.This is a type of
artificial intelligence thatcan produce new content,
including text, images, audio,and synthetic data.So what are large
language models?Large language models refer to
large general-purpose languagemodels that can be
pre-trained and then finetuned for specific purposes.What do pre-trained
and fine tuned mean?Imagine training a dog.Often, you train your
dog basic commandssuch as sit, come,
down, and stay.These commands are normally
sufficient for everyday lifeand help your dog become
a good canine citizen.However, if you need a special
service dog such as a policedog, a guide dog, or a hunting
dog, you add special trainings.The similar idea applies
to large language models.These models are trained
for general purposesto solve common language
problems such as textclassification, question
answering, documentsummarization, and text
generation across industries.The models can then be tailored
to solve specific problemsin different fields
such as retail, finance,and entertainment using a
relatively small size of fielddata sets.Let's further break
down the conceptinto three major features
of large language models.Large indicates two meanings.First is the enormous size
of the training data set,sometimes at the petabyte scale.Second, it refers to
the parameter count.In ML, parameters are often
called hyperparameters.Parameters are basically the
memories and the knowledgethat the machine learned
from the model training.Parameters define
the skill of a modelin solving a problem
such as predicting text.General purpose
means that the modelsare sufficient to
solve common problems.Two reasons lead to this idea.First is the commonality of
a human language regardlessof the specific tasks.And second is the
resource restriction.Only certain organizations
have the capabilityto train such large language
models with huge data setsand a tremendous
number of parameters.How about letting them create
fundamental language modelsfor others to use?This leads to the last point,
pre-trained and fine tuned,meaning to pre-train
a large languagemodel for a general purpose
with a large data setand then fine tune it for
specific aims with a muchsmaller data set.The benefits of using
large language modelsare straightforward.First, a single model can
be used for different tasks.This is a dream come true.These large language
models that aretrained with petabytes of
data and generate billionsof parameters are smart enough
to solve different tasks,including language translation,
sentence completion, textclassification, question
answering, and more.Second, large language models
require minimal field trainingdata when you tailor them to
solve your specific problem.Large language models
obtain decent performanceeven with little
domain training data.In other words, they can be
used for few shot or evenzero-shot scenarios.In machine learning,
few shot refersto training a model
with minimal data,and zero shot implies
that a model can recognizethings that have not explicitly
been taught in the trainingbefore.Third, the performance
of large language modelsis continuously growing when you
add more data and parameters.Let's take PaLM as an example.In April 2022,
Google released PaLM,short for Pathways Language
Model, a 540 billion-parametermodel that achieves a state
of the art performanceacross multiple language tasks.PaLM is a dense decoder-only
transformer model.It has 540 billion parameters.It leverages the
new pathways system,which has enabled
Google to efficientlytrain a single model across
multiple TPU V4 pods.Pathway is a new AI
architecture thatwill handle many tasks at
once, learn new tasks quickly,and reflect a better
understanding of the world.The system enables PaLM
to orchestrate distributedcomputation for accelerators.We previously mentioned that
PaLM is a transformer model.A transformer model consists
of encoder and decoder.The encoder encodes
the input sequenceand passes it to
the decoder, whichlearns how to decode
the representationsfor a relevant task.We've come a long away from
traditional programmingto neural networks
to generative models.In traditional
programming, we usedto have to hard code the rules
for distinguishing a cat--type, animal; legs, four;
ears, two; fur, yes;likes yarn, catnip.In the wave of
neural networks, wecould give the network pictures
of cats and dogs and ask,is this a cat?And it would predict a cat.In the generative
wave, we as userscan generate our own content,
whether it be text, images,audio, video, or other.For example, models
like PaLM, or LaMDA,or Language Model for
Dialogue Applications,ingest very, very large
data from multiple sourcesacross the internet and build
foundation language modelswe can use simply by
asking a question,whether typing it into
a prompt or verballytalking into the prompt.So when you ask it
what's a cat, itcan give you everything it
has learned about a cat.Let's compare LLM development
using pre-trained modelswith traditional ML development.First, with LLM development,
you don't need to be an expert.You don't need
training examples.And there is no need
to train a model.All you need to do is think
about prompt design, whichis the process of creating a
prompt that is clear, concise,and informative.It is an important part of
natural language processing.In traditional
machine learning, youneed training examples
to train a model.You also need compute
time and hardware.Let's take a look at an example
of a text generation use case.Question answering, or QA, is
a subfield of natural languageprocessing that deals with the
task of automatically answeringquestions posed in
natural language.QA systems are typically
trained on a large amountof text and code.And they are able to answer
a wide range of questions,including factual, definitional,
and opinion-based questions.The key here is that you
need domain knowledgeto develop these
question-answering models.For example, domain
knowledge is requiredto develop a question-answering
model for customersupport, or health
care, or supply chain.Using generative QA, the
model generates free textdirectly based on the context.There is no need for
domain knowledge.Let's look at three
questions given to Bard,a large language model chat
bot developed by Google AI.Question one."This year's sales are $100,000.Expenses are $60,000.How much is net profit?"Bard first shares how net
profit is calculated, thenperforms the calculation.Then Bard provides the
definition of net profit.Here's another question.Inventory on hand
is 6,000 units.A new order requires
8,000 units.How many units do I need to
fill to complete the order?Again, Bard answers the question
by performing the calculation.And our last example,
we have 1,000 sensorsin 10 geographic regions.How many sensors do we have
on average in each region?Bard answers the
question with an exampleon how to solve the problem
and some additional context.In each of our questions, a
desired response was obtained.This is due to prompt design.Prompt design and
prompt engineeringare two closely-related concepts
in natural language processing.Both involve the
process of creatinga prompt that is clear,
concise, and informative.However, there are some key
differences between the two.Prompt design is the process
of creating a prompt thatis tailored to the specific
task that this system isbeing asked to perform.For example, if
the system is beingasked to translate a text
from English to French,the prompt should be
written in Englishand should specify that
the translation shouldbe in French.Prompt engineering
is the processof creating a prompt
that is designedto improve performance.This may involve using
domain-specific knowledge,providing examples of
the desired output,or using keywords
that are known to beeffective for the
specific system.Prompt design is a
more general concept,while prompt engineering is
a more specialized concept.Prompt design is essential,
while prompt engineeringis only necessary
for systems thatrequire a high degree of
accuracy or performance.There are three kinds of
large language models,generic language models,
instruction tuned,and dialogue tuned.Each needs prompting
in a different way.Generic language models
predict the next wordbased on the language
in the training data.This is an example of a
generic language model.The next word is a token based
on the language in the trainingdata.In this example,
"the cat sat on,"the next word should be "the."And you can see that "the"
is the most likely next word.Think of this type as an
autocomplete in search.In instruction
tuned, the model istrained to predict a
response to the instructionsgiven in the input.For example,
summarize a text of X,generate a poem
in the style of X,give me a list of keywords based
on semantic similarity for X.And in this example,
classify the textinto neutral,
negative, or positive.In dialogue tuned, the model
is trained to have a dialogueby the next response.Dialogue-tuned models
are a special caseof instruction tuned where
requests are typically framedas questions to a chat bot.Dialogue tuning
is expected to bein the context of a longer
back and forth conversation,and typically works better
with natural question-likephrasings.Chain of thought reasoning
is the observationthat models are better at
getting the right answer whenthey first output
text that explainsthe reason for the answer.Let's look at the question.Roger has five tennis balls.He buys two more
cans of tennis balls.Each can has three tennis balls.How many tennis balls
does he have now?This question is posed
initially with no response.The model is less likely to get
the correct answer directly.However, by the time the
second question is asked,the output is more likely to
end with the correct answer.A model that can do everything
has practical limitations.Task-specific tuning can
make LLMs more reliable.Vertex AI provides
task-specific foundation models.Let's say you have
a use case whereyou need to gather
sentiments, or howyour customers are feeling
about your product or service.You can use the
classification tasksentiment analysis task model.Same for vision tasks.If you need to perform
occupancy analytics,there is a task-specific
model for your use case.Tuning a model enables you to
customize the model responsebased on examples
of the task that youwant the model to perform.It is essentially the
process of adapting a modelto a new domain, or set
of custom use cases,by training the
model on new data.For example, we may
collect training dataand tune the model specifically
for the legal or medicaldomain.You can also further tune
the model by fine tuningwhere you bring
your own data setand retrain the model by
tuning every weight in the LLM.This requires a big
training job and hostingyour own fine-tuned model.Here's an example of a medical
foundation model trainedon health care data.The tasks include question
answering, image analysis,finding similar
patients, and so forth.Fine tuning is expensive and
not realistic in many cases.So are there more efficient
methods of tuning?Yes.Parameter-efficient
tuning methods, or PETM,are methods for tuning
a large languagemodel on your own custom data
without duplicating the model.The base model itself
is not altered.Instead, a small
number of add-on layersare tuned, which can be swapped
in and out at inference time.Generative AI Studio lets you
quickly explore and customizegenerative AI
models that you canleverage in your
applications on Google Cloud.Generative AI Studio helps
developers create and deploygenerative AI
models by providinga variety of tools
and resources thatmake it easy to get started.For example, there's a
library of pre-trained models,a tool for fine tuning models,
a tool for deploying modelsto production, and a
community forum for developersto share ideas and collaborate.Generative AI App
Builder lets youcreate Gen AI apps without
having to write any code.Gen AI App Builder has a
drag-and-drop interfacethat makes it easy
to design and buildapps, a visual editor that
makes it easy to create and editapp content, a built-in search

more general concept,while prompt engineering is
a more specialized concept.Prompt design is essential,
while prompt engineeringis only necessary
for systems thatrequire a high degree of
accuracy or performance.There are three kinds of
large language models,generic language models,
instruction tuned,and dialogue tuned.Each needs prompting
in a different way.Generic language models
predict the next wordbased on the language
in the training data.This is an example of a
generic language model.The next word is a token based
on the language in the trainingdata.In this example,
"the cat sat on,"the next word should be "the."And you can see that "the"
is the most likely next word.Think of this type as an
autocomplete in search.In instruction
tuned, the model istrained to predict a
response to the instructionsgiven in the input.For example,
summarize a text of X,generate a poem
in the style of X,give me a list of keywords based
on semantic similarity for X.And in this example,
classify the textinto neutral,
negative, or positive.In dialogue tuned, the model
is trained to have a dialogueby the next response.Dialogue-tuned models
are a special caseof instruction tuned where
requests are typically framedas questions to a chat bot.Dialogue tuning
is expected to bein the context of a longer
back and forth conversation,and typically works better
with natural question-likephrasings.Chain of thought reasoning
is the observationthat models are better at
getting the right answer whenthey first output
text that explainsthe reason for the answer.Let's look at the question.Roger has five tennis balls.He buys two more
cans of tennis balls.Each can has three tennis balls.How many tennis balls
does he have now?This question is posed
initially with no response.The model is less likely to get
the correct answer directly.However, by the time the
second question is asked,the output is more likely to
end with the correct answer.A model that can do everything
has practical limitations.Task-specific tuning can
make LLMs more reliable.Vertex AI provides
task-specific foundation models.Let's say you have
a use case whereyou need to gather
sentiments, or howyour customers are feeling
about your product or service.You can use the
classification tasksentiment analysis task model.Same for vision tasks.If you need to perform
occupancy analytics,there is a task-specific
model for your use case.Tuning a model enables you to
customize the model responsebased on examples
of the task that youwant the model to perform.It is essentially the
process of adapting a modelto a new domain, or set
of custom use cases,by training the
model on new data.For example, we may
collect training dataand tune the model specifically
for the legal or medicaldomain.You can also further tune
the model by fine tuningwhere you bring
your own data setand retrain the model by
tuning every weight in the LLM.This requires a big
training job and hostingyour own fine-tuned model.Here's an example of a medical
foundation model trainedon health care data.The tasks include question
answering, image analysis,finding similar
patients, and so forth.Fine tuning is expensive and
not realistic in many cases.So are there more efficient
methods of tuning?Yes.Parameter-efficient
tuning methods, or PETM,are methods for tuning
a large languagemodel on your own custom data
without duplicating the model.The base model itself
is not altered.Instead, a small
number of add-on layersare tuned, which can be swapped
in and out at inference time.Generative AI Studio lets you
quickly explore and customizegenerative AI
models that you canleverage in your
applications on Google Cloud.Generative AI Studio helps
developers create and deploygenerative AI
models by providinga variety of tools
and resources thatmake it easy to get started.For example, there's a
library of pre-trained models,a tool for fine tuning models,
a tool for deploying modelsto production, and a
community forum for developersto share ideas and collaborate.Generative AI App
Builder lets youcreate Gen AI apps without
having to write any code.Gen AI App Builder has a
drag-and-drop interfacethat makes it easy
to design and buildapps, a visual editor that
makes it easy to create and editapp content, a built-in search
engine that allows usersto search for information
within the app,and a conversational
AI engine thatallows users to interact with
the app using natural language.You can create your own chat
bots, digital assistants,custom search engines, knowledge
bases, training applications,and more.PaLM API lets you
test and experimentwith Google's large language
models and Gen AI tools.To make prototyping quick
and more accessible,developers can integrate
PaLM API with Maker Suiteand use it to access the
API using a graphical userinterface.The suite includes a
number of different toolssuch as a model-training
tool, a model-deployment tool,and a model-monitoring tool.The model-training tool helps
developers train ML modelson their data using
different algorithms.The model deployment tool helps
developers deploy ML modelsto production with a number of
different deployment options.And the model-monitoring
tool helpsdevelopers monitor the
performance of their ML modelsin production using a
dashboard and a numberof different metrics.That's all for now.Thanks for watching this course,

Video script before going into the complicatednatural language processingarchitectures such as R and nin this video let's have a quick reviewof what all has happened in the world ofNLP in last 10 yearsso here are the things we are going tocover as part of this video first of allwe are going to see history of NLP and Iam going to focus on last 10 yearsbecause most of the development hashappened in last 10 years okaythen we are going to understand thegrowth of NLP with a example so I willtake a use case and explain you how NLPwill solve that use case in2013-2014 15 16 like that okaythen we will see after deep learning whydeep learning has become so popular inthe world of NLP and what is the reasonbehind that we will see some python demowhich will be very interesting we willsolve the same problem that I willdiscuss now and then we are going tounderstand what will be the next tips inthis series okayso you are going to take a lot from thisvideo guys if you just so little bit ofpatience and little bit of attentionOkay so let's start this video withlittle history of NLP so I will just go10 years back okay this is my 2013and this is all the way2023 okay 2013 and 2023. so as many ofyou knowI am working in the industry since 2011okayso I was initially for one one to twoyears I was into Big Data haruk datascience I'm sorry data engineering thosekind of things and later I moved to datascience so I have seen all these phasesfrom 2013 to 23 what all has happened inthe world of NLP okay so I will writehere few important things that you mustfit in your mind then you will be ableto correlate things okay so in 2013 thetime was so I will write here what thetime was okay the time was off I willwrite here some kind of n grams okayn grams all these are differentdifferent techniques in the world of NLPokay n gramssome kind of count based models okaycount based modelsand some kind of word embedding alsostarted coming in this era 2013 and 2014okaythen I will explain you why these modelswere not sufficientand then if you move around 2014 rightif you move around 2014 then two veryvery big things happened in the world ofNLP one is known as recurrent neuralnetwork RNN and other is known as lstmthe other version of you can say RNN oran advanced RNN these two thingsbrought a very big breakthrough in theworld of NLP why I will explain youslowly we will go okay then I willexplain youwhat happened in 2015 issomething camea paper came the name of that paper wasall you needed need is attention Okayand there was introduced something knownas attention mechanismthis attention mechanism changed theentire landscape of natural languageprocessing okay so remember these wordsguys which I am writing here attentionmechanism the paper came in 2015 if I amnot wrongand this changed the entire world of anatural language processing after thateverything took all together a new routea new you know pathwayafter 2015 if we move little furtherright in 2017two important things happened in theworld of NLP okay one is known asTransformersokay Transformers is one kind ofarchitecture based on which many newthings are developed and other importantthing that happened in 2018 I will justwrite here 2018and this is known as something similarto Transformer but not exactlyTransformer but okay another kind ofmodel and as you move to 2020 and 2023all of you know this is the era of GPTbased models and large language modelsis the most new thing that we are seeingin 2023so guys we started fromsome count based models which I willexplain you now and we reached to llmlarge language models okayso I am going to take one simple usecase and try to explain you how thingshave evolved in the world of NLP if youunderstand this right then it will bevery easy for you to digest the theadvanced concepts and how things havemoved okay now few things here wheneverI say NLP right NLP stands for naturallanguage processing in natural languageprocessing there can be text Data therecan be audio data there can be videodata there can be image data okay audiovideoimagethis kind of data can be there and youknow different kinds of use cases can bethere so needless to mention some of theuse cases which you can see of NLP inday-to-day practices for example Gmailauto complete feature I am sure all ofyou would be using this so when youstart writing any email in Gmail it willautomatically auto complete right thatis one feature then you will see somekind of audio to text or text to audiokind of AWS gives you those kind ofdevices in video you can see manyapplications of video analytics right somany of these things fall under thecategory of NLPwe will focus more on text based NLP thereason for that is in Market most of theuse cases that we use and most probablyyou will be working will be text basedfinehaving said that let's take a simpletext based use case and try tounderstand how this use case would havebeen solved using different techniquesand how this will be solved using RNNokay so I will just explain you how thiswould have been solved using varioustechniques beforesupposesuppose I'd write two sentence here okaymy first sentence isI amI am playingI am playingcricketthis is my first sentencemy second sentence ishe isplayinghe is playingfootballokayI take these two sentences now supposethese two sentence is my entire trainingdata suppose this is my entire trainingdataand what I want to do isI have a level against this okay so Ihave a Target variable this is asupervised problem so if this sentenceis a sentence related to Cricket thenclass should be one otherwise classwould be zero so this is my problemstatement okay this is my problemstatement so tomorrow if I write a newsentence here for example I write herecricketis good just an example I am giving thenmy model should be able to predictThis falls in the category of one orzero those integer classificationproblem simple to make it simple you canthink of sentiment classification or anyother model which tells whether this isa positive sentiment or negativesentiment I am taking these two becausepeople are very easily able to relatewith games okayso these are two sentences in front ofyou and you have to use to train yourmodelnow let's understand how people used todo this back in 2013 and 14 okaybefore that let's understand few basicstuff about NLB or text data so I willbe using some term known as documentdocument and another term I will useknown as Corpus so don't confuse betweenthese two words guys document and Corpusin this scenarioeach of these sentences for examplesentence one and sentence two both thesesentences are one one document okay inthis particular use case supposetomorrow you are working on a huge casewhere there are 100 PDF files forexample PDF one okay so on and so forthlet's say you have 100 PDF filessoall these PDF files is one one documentfor you this is first document PDF toeach second document and this is your100th document so every time somebodytells a document you should understandthat this person is talking about oneparticular record or one particularum observation okay so understanddocument like that and somebody talksabout Corpus Corpus is a combination ofall your documents so in my case whatwill be Corpus Corpus is all thesedocuments together so if you if youcombine these two sentences togetherwhat you get is your Corpus Corpus meanseverything that is there in yourum use caseand here if you combine all these 100documents what you get is your Corpus soplease be clear on what is a documentand what is a corpus and keep in mindthese two sentenceswhat is the use case you have toclassify a new sentence based on thatanalysis okayso as all of you know I was telling youNLP will take text Data input date audiodata video data image data and many kindof data but one thing we must understandall the machine learning models or deeplearning models will expect what numbersit will not expect any kind of image ortext or video okay it will work onnumbers okay so your job first job is tosomehowconvert this training information intonumbershow would you do thatthe most basic way of doing that isjust see how many words are there inyour corpus now note here I am sayingCorpus so how many words are there if Itake those two sentences and I startwriting hereI is one word okaym is another wordthe all the words that is there in yourCorpus I am writing okay playing isanother wordCricket is another word okayhe is another word ignore the okay Iwill write like this imagine everythingis lowercase only he is and then I willwrite football okayfootballso if this is the word this is theentire Corpus in front of you right thenwhat I'm going to do is I am going towrite as index here my document 1 and mydocument 2 okay come here and seethe word I is present in your firstdocument or not present so I will makethis one the word m let me take it in adifferent color so that it's easilyyou can understand this is present so Iwill make this one m is present I willmake sorry this will also be 1 because mis present okay playing is present Iwill make this one Cricket is present Iwill make this one he is not present 0is is not present zero football is notpresent zero okayand I will come hereand he is playing football is my secondword so playing will be onefootball will be one he will be one andis will be one this will be zero thiswill be 0 and this will be zero now whyI am explaining you in this detail istry to understand how people try toconvertsentences to numbers back then 10 yearsback and use that in theirclassification model now this becomesyour individual feature so for examplethis is your feature one this is yourfeature twoand so on and so forthand here becomes your target variable sofirst is your Cricket so this willbecome one second is your football sothis will become zero so this is yourtarget variable now this becomes yourcomplete classification problem you cantrain your data on this most basicapproach most fundamental approach thatwas used like way back okay just to giveyou a conceptual understanding of whatused to happen back then and this methodis called as most of you know one hotencoding okay one hotencodingnow if you note it down I just made heresmall case but in the sentence he was inh is in capital letterright so if you see in the sentenceI I am writing here I should havewritten here let me write here in smallcase only it should be small case onlyunderstand this as small case okayeverything understand that is a smallcase so if you notice here few thingsare capital here and few things aresmall letters here but in my in my datapreparation when I'm preparing the dataright I am making everything a smallcase okayand this is one kind of text cleaningthis is one kind of cleaning of Textdata so if you want to understand moreabout what are different text cleaningtechniques and how it is done then Iwant to take your attention to unfolddata science NLP playlist on YouTube soyou have to go and search for unfolddata science NLP you will find a videoplaylist of 12 videosjust watch the video called NLP datacleaning technique okay you will knowwhat are different data cleaningtechniques used in the world of NLP okayso now we have a one hot encodeddocument in front of us but there aresome problems with this approach what isfirst problemfirst problem is this document will beunnecessary very very large becauseunderstand here here we have limitednumber of words what if there are largenumber of words this document will bevery very large and most of the entrieswill be zero so that is a problem ofsomething known as sparse Matrix okaysparse Matrix so it will be very verylarge Matrix and lot of zeros hence itwill take lot of processing time andsecond problem with this is these wordsright these words are treatedindividually okay so words aretreated individuallyindividually means there is no capturingof relation between the words I willgive you examples going forward but youhave to understand all these words aresimply put in a bag so there is aconcept of bag of words so this is verysimple like you have broken all thewords in tokens so what are the tokens Iis one token m is another token playingis another token so what you have doneis you have created a bag like this andyou have put all your words like T1 T2T3 like tokens there is no ordermaintained there is no meaningmaintained right so all these words aretreated separate separate that is oneproblemso what was the next thing that peopledidpeople what they did is they came to theworld of something known as world ofengrams so I will write 2 here and Iwill say the world ofthe world ofn grams I am explaining you all thesetechniques guys so that you'll be veryconfident when you speak to someone okayso remember those two words I am playingCricket he is playing football okay so Iwill write here again so that we cantake reference I am playingcricketokay and he is playing football so thesetwo words are there in front of us nowwhat happened in the world of n grams isthe meaning of n gram is we will createtoken of multiple words together not asingle single word okay so n gram can beone gram also and N gram can be 2 gramalso and N gram can be many grams okayit can be 4 gram 5 gram six grams and inthe end it can be n gram okay so what isthe meaning of this if I have to takeone gram tokens from this right then mytokens will be IM playing all those things that wasthere in the previous example so onegram is nothing different than one hotencoding okayso what will be your one gram uh tokensCricket then he then is and thenfootball these are your one gram tokensokay very similar to your one hotencoding in two gram tokens you willtake two words together for example I amthis is your one tokenM playing this is your another tokenokayand then playing Cricket this is yourthird token two gram token understandguys what people were trying to do isthey were trying to understand which twowords or three words come togethersuppose I write here three gram tokenrightso in three gram token how it will becreated I am playing this is one tokenokay and then another token will be Mplaying Cricket M playing Cricket sounderstand this will not be taken fromone document only from the entire Corpusthis will be taken okay this is threegram token and similarly you can createa n gram tokens from this as many aswords you want to take what is theadvantage the advantage is supposeplaying Cricket is coming here soplaying football will also come so itwill at least capture some meaning sohow do you create your your datatraining data so for example this isyour document one this is your documenttwo so you will write your n gram tokenshere so n gramtokens this will be your one set offeatures this will be your one set offeaturesthen you sorry I'm sorry one gram tokensyou can say and then here you can say 2gram tokens two gram tokens will be yourother set of featuresand then three gram tokens and so on andso forth how many ever you want to takeso if I want to take one gram token is Ipresent yes is M present yes two gramtoken i m is present yes M playing ispresent yes playing Cricket is presentyes playing football is present nosimilarly for this and similarly fordocument two now what is happening hereyou are trying to capture some contextso for document 2 also maybe one onesome zero some one some zero some oneokay and then here in the end yourtarget variable will be there one orzero so now the prediction can happen onthis so this becomes your training datayou have lot of features now and thenyouryou know you can train your model basedon this so how this model is differentfrom basic one hot encoding at leastsome meaning of the word and some morecontext we are trying to understand thisis the world of engrams okaynow let's move to the Thirdwhat is the problem with n grams againsparse metric problem andyou know it is not very efficient howmany tokens you will create how manygrams you will create right so one gramitself will be very too many tokens 2grams will be too many tokens threegrams will be too many tokens right manytokens will be there so how many you cankeep creating right so this is again asparse metric problem computationproblemas the third technique people move tosomething known as TF IDF okay TF standsfor term frequency and IDF stands forinverse document frequencywhat is the purpose of this particularmechanism is suppose there are two wordsin front of you the two sentences that Ijust mentioned for example just tounderstand simply I will write it hereagainI am playing cricketokay and then he is playing footballif you notice here in these twosentences guys playing word is common inboth these sentences okaybut what differentiates these twosentences the presence of cricket andfootballso in TF IDF the prime agenda is to notlook sentences individually okay so inall these techniques till now you mightbe noticing sentences or documents arelooked individually and these numbersare computedin TF IDF sentences and Corpus is lookedtogether and a differentiator is triedto create here so how the differentiatorwill be created is Words which arecommon across all the documents thesewill be given low weight is okay andWords which is present in only onedocuments these will be given how it ahigh weightage for that particulardocument there is a complete mathematicsbehind it for example if I write hereCricket okay and if I write herefootballokay and if I write here playingand I want to compute TF IDF score ofdocument 1 and document 2 then indocument 1 the TF IDF score for Cricketwill be high in document 2 the TF IDFscore for football will be highthe playing score in both thesedocuments will be very very low or zerothe reason for that is playing is acommon word in both these documents andthe differentiator is cricket andfootball so their numbers will be highthere is a complete mathematics behindit if you want to go in more detail guysagain I will refer you to the sameplaylist that I was mentioning and hereyou can go and see feature extractiontechniques from bag of words to TF IDFcount vectorizer and TF IDF and I havedone one use case also using tfidf so itwill be very easy for you to understandfrom here all the mathematics I haveexplained there okay so now what ishappening now entire Corpus peoplepeople started looking together and tryto understand the meaning of words andcompute TF IDF TF IDF can be computedfor n gram tokens also not individualtokens suppose I want to compute TF ideafor this or this or this I can very welldo that that is doable okayso up to tfidf at least some somemeaning started coming in the world ofNLP some some things we are able tocapture rightnow tfidf was number three I was justchecking which number I am in and then Iwill go to number four now what isnumber four as it moves forward itbecomes little more interesting let mesee my notes here once which I havenoted at number four at number four wewill learn something about the world ofword embedding the world ofword embedding now one thing to noticehere guys till now we are processingdocument by document if you notice hereall these techniques will go and lookfor word occurrence in a document andcreate a matrix based on thatwhat if I want to process my documentword by word what if I want to processmy machine learning engine word by wordfor example here I have a sentence I amplayingCricket okayso I do not want to process thissentence as a whole rather I want tolearn from word by word so I will treatI first then I will treat M then I willread playing then I will read Cricket sohow would you do that how would you youknow treat word so word needs to beconverted to numbers and those arecalled word vectors okay remember thisterminology guys word vectors wordvectors means what if I create a vectorfrom this wordhow will you create a vector from thiswordone famous technique is known as againone hot encoding one or encodingokayone hot encoding what it will do is itwill simply assign a number to all thewords in your Corpus for example howmany words are there in my Corpus I amplayingCricket let's take first sentence onlyjust to make you understand I am nottaking the second sentence now suppose Iis your word number one aim is your wordnumber two playing is your word numberthree Cricket is your word number fourso if you do a one hot encoding rightthenthis is how your same sentence will looklike one zero zero zero this is yourfirst word try to understand this guythis is the base for everything in RNand lstm and large language models okayone zero zero zero is your first wordthen 0 1 0 0 is your second wordokay because m is number two m is numbertwo right so second word becomes onethird word becomes0 0 1 0 third wordfourth word zero zero zero oneso try to understand don't confuse thisentire thing is your first sentence thisentire thing is your first sentence okayand this is your word one this is yourword two this is your word three andthis is your word four and this iscalled this one zero zero this thing isword Vector this is word Vector this isword vector and this is word vectorso I told you one technique of one hotencodingto encode your numbers word into wordvectorsand from this only the AdvancedTechniques ofword embedding came into picture okay Iam going to show you in Python how theadvanced word embeddings are workingbut one thing I want to tell you herewhen word embeddings came into into thepicture then artificial neural networksstarted gaining lot of attention in theindustry artificial neural networks whybecause it needs lot of processing powerNow understand guysthis looks much simpler if I talk fromprocessing point of view right frommachine point of view processing pointof view if I go document by document itlooks little simpler right but if I goword by word right then my input itselfis becoming very very huge so processingwill become huge and it will need morememory and more complex Network and thatis when the artificial neural networksbecome popular then word embeddings andall these things started taking pictureI started taking you know front seat inthe world of NLP so what is the problemof with word embedding againthis is computationally expensive as Itold you the input will go all togetherin different way now using tensors so ifyou don't know the concept of tensorsguys please read about it it's a veryvery simple topic to understand you cansimply you know if you are a python guyyou can simply think it liken-dimensional array okay ND array inPythonso if there is one value one singlevalue then this is like one one scalarvalue if I write like one two three fourthis is one kind of vector value and Ican write a 2d Vector I can write a 3DVector I can write a n dimensionalVector right so in the world of machinelearning tensors are nothing but you canthink of n dimensional array and wherethat is used is now suppose this thissentence you have to give input to yourtraining rightthis sentence so this sentence itselfhas become a n dimensional array if yousee this right so this has become a ndimensional array so this will be calledas a tensor okay so it will go in inputas a tensor so nothing to confuse theirtensor means input is going in Ndimensional array you have to understandand since artificial neural network cameso these computations became possiblenow if I go one level from here thenthere are different types of wordembedding I I explained you a simpleword embedding technique that is one hotbut there are different types of wordembedding techniques for example what towake is a word embedding technique okayGlobe is another word word embeddingtechnique so what these will do is thiswill give a more meaningful embedding toyour words for example if I take what towake as an example right and if I takeCricket as a word soin normal what one hot encoding it willjust be one zero one zero one zero rightbut this is a pre-trained model what tomake is a pre-trained model and Globe isalso a pre-trained model when you take apre-trend model and when you embed yourmachine learning model your data rightso it will be featured on some of theother dimensions for exampleis a game is outdoor okay is outdooris multiplayer I'm writing here somefeatures on these features your wordwill be given as score so Cricket is agame so 0.9 score out of oneis an outdoor game 0.8 score out of oneis multiplayer game 0.9 score out of oneso this becomes your vector I am justwriting here three it can be a 300 or3000 Vector Dimension vector so I amwriting herenot Dimension objects you know presenceof elements in the vector so 0.9 0.8 0.9this is your vector Cricket okay anotherword comes one more Vector getsgenerated so if you compare from yournormal 114 coding right then that thatlooks little more meaningful okay sothat is one kind of Advance you can sayword embedding technique if you comparelike you know some time backbut I am going to show you in Pythonin Keras right in Keras which is whichis a deep learning framework it givesyou its own embedding layer okay itgives you its own embedding layer inKeras so what you can do is this is afamous deep learning frameworkin Keras you can simply say that this ismy Vector this is my document embed mydocument and you can just get yourembedding done I and there is one moreembedding that I will show you in Pythonnow that is known as integer basedencoding that is very similar to what wesaw in one hot encoding okay integerbased encoding so try to understand guyshow things are improving in the world ofNLP I am going to python now and showyou how these things are workingtogetherjust a quick revisionall these things we have understood howthe NLP has improved right from countvectorizer counting the number of wordshere in place of one zero you can alsowrite count of the word okay that iscounting the number of wordsthen problems with this then the worldof engrams then what happened in TF IDFand then how the word embedding cameinto picture so converting what twovectors came into picture somesophisticated way of converting what twovectors came into picture and then let'sgo to Python and see what are differentembedding techniques that I want to showyouso here guys I have taken these twolines as you can see import numpy SNP myCorpus so what is my Corpus my Corpus issimply combination of those twosentences that I am writing I am playingCricket he is playing football this ismy two documents or two sentences thatyou can see here I will say enterfrom Keras dot preprocessing I amimporting tokenizer now some of you whois not aware of any concept of deeplearning or neural network you have togo to unfold data science deep learningand write from intuition behind neuralnetwork you will find all the video tilloptimizers in neural network okayso everything that I will speak fromhere on if you have any confusionsplease go and see this playlist 15videos all these are very very usefulfor you okayso going back toKeras is a famous deep learningframework I will say here from Keras Iam importing preprocessing dot textand I am sayingI am initializing a tokenizer objecttokenizer object means it will tokenizemy my Corpusand then I am calling a method calledfit on text and then if you see hereguys whatever I am highlighting rightthe the fit on text has given one numberto all the words in my Corpus so playingis my word number one I is my wordnumber two m is my word number threeCricket is my word number four he is myword number fiveis six football seven so as I wastelling you in a theory rightif you see here he is H is capital herebut in the token at least small how thatbecomes small because Keras itself didsome pre-processing on my text try tounderstand this Keras itself did somepre-processing on my text and convertedeverything to lowercase and assigned anumber at the moment my words areassigned one one number right and thenif I run text to sequences rightthen you will see that my my originaldocument are these two okay so my firstmy first document is I am playingcricketand my second document is he is playingfootballokayso I is which number word I it's secondnumber word so two okay you can see herethese two words are represented in termsof integers now these two sentencesso two three one four means I am playingcricket2 is i m is 3 playing is one Cricket isfour so two three one four is my firstsentenceokay five six one seven same way is mysecond sentence he is playing footballhe is five is six playingone and football seven so what I havedone here is I have imported a pythonpackage from Keras and I have convertedmy text to numbers using something knownas integer embedding this is called as ainteger embedding all your words will begiven one one integer numberand your sentence will be converted likethis very similar to one hot encodingjust that numbers are here integernumbers are here okayso if we move from here the othertechnique the other word embeddingtechnique that I want to show you comesdirectly from Keras Keras will embed itfor you so if I go here anduh I am just creating a pad sequencewhichwhich I am creating for for some purposeI will come back to this later butbefore that guys here as you can seeimport tensorflow I am importingembedding layer and then flatten anddense and simple adenine M lot usingdon't worry about all thisif you seemost of these things I'm not usingwhatever I'm highlighting okay just I'musing sequential model and I am usingembedding layer so as you can see justfocus on line number six seven and eightwhatever I am highlighting herefrom Keras I am taking a sequentiallayerand then I am adding a embeddingembedding means I want to embed my inputand then I am saying it why I'm saying 8because there are seven unique words inmy vocab how many unique words are therein my vocab seven unique words in myvocab so in Keras embedding you have togive n Plus 1. so 8 output Dimension Iwant three and input length is fourinput length is what is the length of mymy each sentence so here in this boxwhat I am doing is I'm just padding sowhat is the concept of padding I willtell yousuppose Suppose there are two sentencesone is i m and other is i mAman okay so when you send when youconvert this sentence to integerencoding or any kind of encoding rightsuppose this will have 15 and M is let'ssay 16 number word so this is theinteger encoding for this rightand here suppose 15 and then 16 and thena money is let's say 17. so this Vectoris of size 3 and this Vector is of sizesorry this Vector is of size 2 and thisis of size 3. I don't want that tohappen because that will create problemin my machine learning so I want boththese vectors to be same size for makingit same size there is a concept ofpadding so what padding will do is itwill add 0 just to make it a fixednumber for example I say make it paddingis equal to 0 and add 0 in pre pre meansbefore this or post means after this sothen I will get two vectors15 16 0 this is my first sentence and 1516 and 17 this is my second sentenceokay so this is padding what paddingdoes it makes your vectors equal size byadding zeros in front or in the back sothat is what I am doing here from Kerasutils import pad sequences and I amsaying if some word is not in the sameuh word if if sum is not in the same youknow length then convert that to samelength but in this case both my wordsare four four four numbers only so thisis fine this will not do anythingnow what I am doing I am the same thingI am giving here input length is equalto 4. so what I'm asking to Keras istake these input okay take these inputand give me an output of threedimensions so let's come back to our ourhere againso now what we have iswe have words okay and in our words wehave how many how many vocab seven vocabseven is myvocab size vocab size means how manyunique words are there in your vocab soif you come here right one two threefour five six seven seven unique wordsin my vocabso when the vector will be created onehot encoded Vector will be created thenit will be created how many entries willbe there for example suppose for Cricketwhat I want to create a one hot encodedvector so how many elements will be herethere will be seven elements right sevenelements so first element will representI second M like that okay so onlyCricket will be one rest all will bezero so what I am saying is 7 is myvocab size so when my model will getcreated the embedding model it will looklike this one two three four five sixsevenokay and then I am saying outputDimension will be three output Dimensionwill be three means one two and threewill be my output so what I want to do Iwant to create a fully connected neuralnetwork herefully connected neural network herewhere I am saying to Keras embeddingthat take my word suppose my Cricketword looks like this one zero zero zerozero zero zero seven one two three fourfive six seven so suppose my Cricketword looks like thisnow do not confuse between these numbersand this encoded number so this is wordnumber two for example my is word numbertwo so this encoding will happeninternally otherwise it cannot send itto the vector space okay so thisencoding will happen internallywhat you have here is one number foreach word okay so one two three fourfive six seven suppose we are talkingabout two word number two right so thatword number two will become one restwill become zero this goes as input toyour embedding layer or this model inthis case and what I am saying to Kerasis give me a three dimension outputthree dimension output is encode my wordin a three dimension space so threedimension space meansit will be a D1 and D2 and D3 so my wordCricket my word Cricket will have somescore on these three so this score canbe let's say 0.6 minus 0.4 and 0.2similarly my word footballmy word football can have a score of 0.5on this 0.2 and 0.1 something like thiswhat I am saying to Keras is take all mywords one by one Words which are encodedin integer format remember this integerformat words will be converted to onehot vectors before sending it to themodel so two number word only this placewill become one rest all will becomezero that will be sent and the outputwhat you get is a three dimension outputokay so if I run this model hereand if I predict for example I amcompiling this model and I am predictingon my padded sequence my padded sequencein same input data I am predicting onokayif I am predicting on my padded sequencethat is same input data what you willnotice here is now my word number2 my word number 2 is represented bythisthis is my word number twookay please pay attention here guysmy word number twowent to the model learned the embeddingand with when it came back afterembedding it is represented like thisokay similarly the next word isrepresented like this so all the wordsin my padded sequence which was there onwhich model was trained only okay hasbeen converted into a three dimensionalnumbers now your original sentence youroriginal sentence these two sentencesarethese three dimensional numbers now nowyou can take these numbers you can trainyour model and do whatever you want okaybefore I train my model I will explainyou one more time what has been doneherethis is your original sentencefrom your original sentence what you didyou created tokens tokens Missindividual words in those individualwords you assigned a number for exampleplaying is first word I is second wordaim is third word and so on and so forthonce this happened then you said okaycreate a sequence from my Corpusnow the first sentence has beenconverted to a series of numbers becauseyou know now system identifies that as anumber so I is number two m is numberthree playing is number one and Cricketis number four okaynow what I want to do is I want to takeadvantage of Keras embedding layer sowhen I want to send this to Kerasembedding for one more layer ofembeddingthen if I send this my sequences rightthen it will get converted into a onehot Vector all these words will beconverted into one hot vector and thosewill be predicted based on Kerasembedding so when the embedding resultscomes out for all the word I will havethree three numbers that I am trying toshow you there for all the words threethree numbersokayfor all the words three three numbersone two three number four first word onetwo three number four fourth word and soon and so forth I can take this data andtrain a model let's do that so till nowif you notice I have not defined mytarget variableI am solving this as a classificationproblem okayso here what I'm trying to do I amtrying tofrom numpy import I am importing anarray and I am calling sentence level isequal to array one zero array one zeromeans I am trying to predict if a givensentence falls in the category ofcricket so one means Cricket zero meansno Cricket Okay soI am giving 1 0 I will call this as ismy sentence models okay now if you seehere I am again taking sequential I amadding same with the embedding layerthat that I was doing aboveand then I'm adding a flattening layerand this is a very simple basic neuralnetwork if you have confusions you canwatch you know components of neuralnetwork video it will be very very clearto you what I am doing here very simpleneural networkand sigmoid because this is aclassification problem so training thisneural networkhere if you see I am taking a newsentencehe is playing football okayand this new sentence has been convertedinto a sequence using same token Azurethat we did above so if you see herethe same tokenizer that we used above mytokenizer right using this tokenizeronlyI have converted my sentence intosentence sequenceand then I have added because I want toensure it's a free four four thing fourcharacter thingand then I have predicted and if you cansee here my prediction is 0 0 means itisnot Cricket because my input line hereiswhat is my input line heremy input line here is it is footballokayso what I did in this model up to here Icreated my text into numbers then Iadded a label because I did not had inthe beginningand then I defined a neural networkmodel with one just one embedding layerone flattened layer and Target is densebecause this is a sigmoid because thisis a binary classification problem Icompiled my modelandI just fit my model and I am predictingwith a new sentence my new sentence ishe's playing football on this newsentence I am predicting when I ampredicting I am getting my prediction aszero zero because this is not a cricketrelated word okayand here all the pre-processing that Iam doing it is based on thepre-processing what I did in thetraining dataso what is this is a simpleclassification problem that is solved infront of you using simple most basicneural network okay most basic neuralnetwork using thatI solved a simple classification problemnowmy question to you first question to youwhich I want you to write me in commentiswhy total number of parameters and totalnumber of trainable parameters is 24here that is the first thing that youhave to write me in comment okay thinkon that and write me if you understandthe neural network architecture you willbe easily able to explain me why that is24 only why not something else okayyou have to explain me in the commentthen second thing that I want to capturehere I want to go back there and try toexplain you that we have coveredeverything up to word embedding okay sowhich means that we have coveredeverything up to whatever happenedbefore the world of RNNso why RNN came into picture what is theuse of RNN we have all these techniquesthen why RNN has come into pictureso I will write here one wordokay one sentence and then we will thinktogether for example I write hereI wasI wasborninGermanyI was born in Germanyand henceand hencecanspeakblankso what do you think will be here in theblankobviously you and me are human so we cansimply think it will be German okaybecause somebody is born in Germany sohe or she can speak German how did youcome to that conclusionbecause whatever was written before thisusing this memory rightyou went backwards and you understoodwhat was said before what was saidbefore is I was born in Germanyokay and this information I was born inGermany was useful in determining whatwill be the next word or in other wayyou can say in useful in understandingthe context of a given line or sentenceokayin none of these models in none of thesemodels that we have discussed till nowwhatever kind of word embedding we havedone whatever kind of advancement wehave donetill now we don't have capacity andcapability of remembering what happenedbefore for examplein this sentence there are four wordsokay in integer based encoding or anyencoding you do rightall these words will goand all these words will you knowprediction will happen so one ndimensional array will get created One ndimensional array will get created whichwe call tensors alsothat will go as the input in any neuralnetwork and output will come and thenthe loss will be optimized that is howit will work but there is no way theprevious information can be captured orstored or memorized what is meant byprevious information is in this casesuppose the the sentence is I am AmanI goes as a word Vector aim goes asanother word Vector Aman goes as anotherword vectorbut there is no way in a normalartificial neural network that I canremember when I when I reach Aman firstof all all these things will beprocessed together only so there is nono time to reach something okay butsuppose when I reach Aman I don't haveany information about what was beforeRamanand if you don't have this informationwhat was before amand then you knowunderstanding what can happen after thator understand the completecontext of that becomes very verydifficult that is one problem with allthese approaches that we have done tillnowwhat is the other problemso I am writing another word here forexample I say I wasI was walkingI was walkingonon Bankof riverokayor this is one my favorite I will takeokay so for example I can say I work atAppleokay and here I say I eat applenow based on the context right themeaning of word apple is changing a lotso another example of how the contextbased on the context the meaning of thesentence and word changes and then thereare some sentences where there isconfusion there is a referentialambiguity you don't understand what thissentence is for examplechickenisreadyto eat now whether chicken is ready toeat something or chicken is cooked toeat we don't know that sounderstanding the sarcasm understandingthe the context of a saying sentence ina given given scenario right all thesethings can be possible only when youremember the previous words in thenetwork so scientists and researchershad to find out a way to remember whathappened before remember what was saidbefore and keep that information in thenetworkso that by looking at that informationyou know the better predictions can bemade and that is wherethe born you know the new type of neuralnetworks was Bond and that is known asrecurrent neural network or R and N okayso that is where the new type of neuralnetwork was born in 2014 especially forsequential data so whatever data I keptI discussed now came into the categoryof sequential data for example asentence right I am Aman okayleavinglivinginDash testsso if somebody knows where Aman livesthey can fill this sentence so this is akind of sequential data where next thingdepends on previous thing and next thinghas relation from the previous thingokay and suppose you want to predictstock market data so maybe maybe somestock price is let's say 1200 1250 12 30and then 1180 and then 11 20 and then 1215 so what will be the next predictionit will depend on the previous value sothis this kind of data is calledsequential data so to solve the problemof sequential data and to memorize theinformation there was this architectureBond RNNand another variant of RNA is lstmso I am going to cover in my next videothe architecture of RNN and how RNNworks and how it is used in the Deeplearning and in sequence models and thenwe will go on to the advanced topicsokayso what you have to do guys I showed youtwo playlists here one is artificialneural network Basics if you don't knowBasics it will not be easy for you tounderstand Advanced topics okay so justgo through this and understand thebasics welland NLP Basics like data cleaning orword embedding or what vectors and thesethings I covered but again go here andsee which videos you want to see andwhich videos make sense for you watchthose videos okayjust to recap what all we covered todayis a brief history of NLP till RNN okaydifferent techniques from the beginningword from wordcon to TF IDF to n gramdiagrams right toward embeddings twodifferent types of word embedding andthen why what embedding is not thatgreat and what is what are the problemswith word embedding what is padding andI showed you a sentiment analysis hugecase of word embedding using very verysimple sentiment analysis use case usinginteger embedding Keras embedding wesolve that huge caseso please let me know what are yourquestions and how how did you like thisvideo guys as always your comments aremy motivation so please keep commentingand you know press like if you like

Video script before going into the complicatednatural language processingarchitectures such as R and nin this video let's have a quick reviewof what all has happened in the world ofNLP in last 10 yearsso here are the things we are going tocover as part of this video first of allwe are going to see history of NLP and Iam going to focus on last 10 yearsbecause most of the development hashappened in last 10 years okaythen we are going to understand thegrowth of NLP with a example so I willtake a use case and explain you how NLPwill solve that use case in2013-2014 15 16 like that okaythen we will see after deep learning whydeep learning has become so popular inthe world of NLP and what is the reasonbehind that we will see some python demowhich will be very interesting we willsolve the same problem that I willdiscuss now and then we are going tounderstand what will be the next tips inthis series okayso you are going to take a lot from thisvideo guys if you just so little bit ofpatience and little bit of attentionOkay so let's start this video withlittle history of NLP so I will just go10 years back okay this is my 2013and this is all the way2023 okay 2013 and 2023. so as many ofyou knowI am working in the industry since 2011okayso I was initially for one one to twoyears I was into Big Data haruk datascience I'm sorry data engineering thosekind of things and later I moved to datascience so I have seen all these phasesfrom 2013 to 23 what all has happened inthe world of NLP okay so I will writehere few important things that you mustfit in your mind then you will be ableto correlate things okay so in 2013 thetime was so I will write here what thetime was okay the time was off I willwrite here some kind of n grams okayn grams all these are differentdifferent techniques in the world of NLPokay n gramssome kind of count based models okaycount based modelsand some kind of word embedding alsostarted coming in this era 2013 and 2014okaythen I will explain you why these modelswere not sufficientand then if you move around 2014 rightif you move around 2014 then two veryvery big things happened in the world ofNLP one is known as recurrent neuralnetwork RNN and other is known as lstmthe other version of you can say RNN oran advanced RNN these two thingsbrought a very big breakthrough in theworld of NLP why I will explain youslowly we will go okay then I willexplain youwhat happened in 2015 issomething camea paper came the name of that paper wasall you needed need is attention Okayand there was introduced something knownas attention mechanismthis attention mechanism changed theentire landscape of natural languageprocessing okay so remember these wordsguys which I am writing here attentionmechanism the paper came in 2015 if I amnot wrongand this changed the entire world of anatural language processing after thateverything took all together a new routea new you know pathwayafter 2015 if we move little furtherright in 2017two important things happened in theworld of NLP okay one is known asTransformersokay Transformers is one kind ofarchitecture based on which many newthings are developed and other importantthing that happened in 2018 I will justwrite here 2018and this is known as something similarto Transformer but not exactlyTransformer but okay another kind ofmodel and as you move to 2020 and 2023all of you know this is the era of GPTbased models and large language modelsis the most new thing that we are seeingin 2023so guys we started fromsome count based models which I willexplain you now and we reached to llmlarge language models okayso I am going to take one simple usecase and try to explain you how thingshave evolved in the world of NLP if youunderstand this right then it will bevery easy for you to digest the theadvanced concepts and how things havemoved okay now few things here wheneverI say NLP right NLP stands for naturallanguage processing in natural languageprocessing there can be text Data therecan be audio data there can be videodata there can be image data okay audiovideoimagethis kind of data can be there and youknow different kinds of use cases can bethere so needless to mention some of theuse cases which you can see of NLP inday-to-day practices for example Gmailauto complete feature I am sure all ofyou would be using this so when youstart writing any email in Gmail it willautomatically auto complete right thatis one feature then you will see somekind of audio to text or text to audiokind of AWS gives you those kind ofdevices in video you can see manyapplications of video analytics right somany of these things fall under thecategory of NLPwe will focus more on text based NLP thereason for that is in Market most of theuse cases that we use and most probablyyou will be working will be text basedfinehaving said that let's take a simpletext based use case and try tounderstand how this use case would havebeen solved using different techniquesand how this will be solved using RNNokay so I will just explain you how thiswould have been solved using varioustechniques beforesupposesuppose I'd write two sentence here okaymy first sentence isI amI am playingI am playingcricketthis is my first sentencemy second sentence ishe isplayinghe is playingfootballokayI take these two sentences now supposethese two sentence is my entire trainingdata suppose this is my entire trainingdataand what I want to do isI have a level against this okay so Ihave a Target variable this is asupervised problem so if this sentenceis a sentence related to Cricket thenclass should be one otherwise classwould be zero so this is my problemstatement okay this is my problemstatement so tomorrow if I write a newsentence here for example I write herecricketis good just an example I am giving thenmy model should be able to predictThis falls in the category of one orzero those integer classificationproblem simple to make it simple you canthink of sentiment classification or anyother model which tells whether this isa positive sentiment or negativesentiment I am taking these two becausepeople are very easily able to relatewith games okayso these are two sentences in front ofyou and you have to use to train yourmodelnow let's understand how people used todo this back in 2013 and 14 okaybefore that let's understand few basicstuff about NLB or text data so I willbe using some term known as documentdocument and another term I will useknown as Corpus so don't confuse betweenthese two words guys document and Corpusin this scenarioeach of these sentences for examplesentence one and sentence two both thesesentences are one one document okay inthis particular use case supposetomorrow you are working on a huge casewhere there are 100 PDF files forexample PDF one okay so on and so forthlet's say you have 100 PDF filessoall these PDF files is one one documentfor you this is first document PDF toeach second document and this is your100th document so every time somebodytells a document you should understandthat this person is talking about oneparticular record or one particularum observation okay so understanddocument like that and somebody talksabout Corpus Corpus is a combination ofall your documents so in my case whatwill be Corpus Corpus is all thesedocuments together so if you if youcombine these two sentences togetherwhat you get is your Corpus Corpus meanseverything that is there in yourum use caseand here if you combine all these 100documents what you get is your Corpus soplease be clear on what is a documentand what is a corpus and keep in mindthese two sentenceswhat is the use case you have toclassify a new sentence based on thatanalysis okayso as all of you know I was telling youNLP will take text Data input date audiodata video data image data and many kindof data but one thing we must understandall the machine learning models or deeplearning models will expect what numbersit will not expect any kind of image ortext or video okay it will work onnumbers okay so your job first job is tosomehowconvert this training information intonumbershow would you do thatthe most basic way of doing that isjust see how many words are there inyour corpus now note here I am sayingCorpus so how many words are there if Itake those two sentences and I startwriting hereI is one word okaym is another wordthe all the words that is there in yourCorpus I am writing okay playing isanother wordCricket is another word okayhe is another word ignore the okay Iwill write like this imagine everythingis lowercase only he is and then I willwrite football okayfootballso if this is the word this is theentire Corpus in front of you right thenwhat I'm going to do is I am going towrite as index here my document 1 and mydocument 2 okay come here and seethe word I is present in your firstdocument or not present so I will makethis one the word m let me take it in adifferent color so that it's easilyyou can understand this is present so Iwill make this one m is present I willmake sorry this will also be 1 because mis present okay playing is present Iwill make this one Cricket is present Iwill make this one he is not present 0is is not present zero football is notpresent zero okayand I will come hereand he is playing football is my secondword so playing will be onefootball will be one he will be one andis will be one this will be zero thiswill be 0 and this will be zero now whyI am explaining you in this detail istry to understand how people try toconvertsentences to numbers back then 10 yearsback and use that in theirclassification model now this becomesyour individual feature so for examplethis is your feature one this is yourfeature twoand so on and so forthand here becomes your target variable sofirst is your Cricket so this willbecome one second is your football sothis will become zero so this is yourtarget variable now this becomes yourcomplete classification problem you cantrain your data on this most basicapproach most fundamental approach thatwas used like way back okay just to giveyou a conceptual understanding of whatused to happen back then and this methodis called as most of you know one hotencoding okay one hotencodingnow if you note it down I just made heresmall case but in the sentence he was inh is in capital letterright so if you see in the sentenceI I am writing here I should havewritten here let me write here in smallcase only it should be small case onlyunderstand this as small case okayeverything understand that is a smallcase so if you notice here few thingsare capital here and few things aresmall letters here but in my in my datapreparation when I'm preparing the dataright I am making everything a smallcase okayand this is one kind of text cleaningthis is one kind of cleaning of Textdata so if you want to understand moreabout what are different text cleaningtechniques and how it is done then Iwant to take your attention to unfolddata science NLP playlist on YouTube soyou have to go and search for unfolddata science NLP you will find a videoplaylist of 12 videosjust watch the video called NLP datacleaning technique okay you will knowwhat are different data cleaningtechniques used in the world of NLP okayso now we have a one hot encodeddocument in front of us but there aresome problems with this approach what isfirst problemfirst problem is this document will beunnecessary very very large becauseunderstand here here we have limitednumber of words what if there are largenumber of words this document will bevery very large and most of the entrieswill be zero so that is a problem ofsomething known as sparse Matrix okaysparse Matrix so it will be very verylarge Matrix and lot of zeros hence itwill take lot of processing time andsecond problem with this is these wordsright these words are treatedindividually okay so words aretreated individuallyindividually means there is no capturingof relation between the words I willgive you examples going forward but youhave to understand all these words aresimply put in a bag so there is aconcept of bag of words so this is verysimple like you have broken all thewords in tokens so what are the tokens Iis one token m is another token playingis another token so what you have doneis you have created a bag like this andyou have put all your words like T1 T2T3 like tokens there is no ordermaintained there is no meaningmaintained right so all these words aretreated separate separate that is oneproblemso what was the next thing that peopledidpeople what they did is they came to theworld of something known as world ofengrams so I will write 2 here and Iwill say the world ofthe world ofn grams I am explaining you all thesetechniques guys so that you'll be veryconfident when you speak to someone okayso remember those two words I am playingCricket he is playing football okay so Iwill write here again so that we cantake reference I am playingcricketokay and he is playing football so thesetwo words are there in front of us nowwhat happened in the world of n grams isthe meaning of n gram is we will createtoken of multiple words together not asingle single word okay so n gram can beone gram also and N gram can be 2 gramalso and N gram can be many grams okayit can be 4 gram 5 gram six grams and inthe end it can be n gram okay so what isthe meaning of this if I have to takeone gram tokens from this right then mytokens will be IM playing all those things that wasthere in the previous example so onegram is nothing different than one hotencoding okayso what will be your one gram uh tokensCricket then he then is and thenfootball these are your one gram tokensokay very similar to your one hotencoding in two gram tokens you willtake two words together for example I amthis is your one tokenM playing this is your another tokenokayand then playing Cricket this is yourthird token two gram token understandguys what people were trying to do isthey were trying to understand which twowords or three words come togethersuppose I write here three gram tokenrightso in three gram token how it will becreated I am playing this is one tokenokay and then another token will be Mplaying Cricket M playing Cricket sounderstand this will not be taken fromone document only from the entire Corpusthis will be taken okay this is threegram token and similarly you can createa n gram tokens from this as many aswords you want to take what is theadvantage the advantage is supposeplaying Cricket is coming here soplaying football will also come so itwill at least capture some meaning sohow do you create your your datatraining data so for example this isyour document one this is your documenttwo so you will write your n gram tokenshere so n gramtokens this will be your one set offeatures this will be your one set offeaturesthen you sorry I'm sorry one gram tokensyou can say and then here you can say 2gram tokens two gram tokens will be yourother set of featuresand then three gram tokens and so on andso forth how many ever you want to takeso if I want to take one gram token is Ipresent yes is M present yes two gramtoken i m is present yes M playing ispresent yes playing Cricket is presentyes playing football is present nosimilarly for this and similarly fordocument two now what is happening hereyou are trying to capture some contextso for document 2 also maybe one onesome zero some one some zero some oneokay and then here in the end yourtarget variable will be there one orzero so now the prediction can happen onthis so this becomes your training datayou have lot of features now and thenyouryou know you can train your model basedon this so how this model is differentfrom basic one hot encoding at leastsome meaning of the word and some morecontext we are trying to understand thisis the world of engrams okaynow let's move to the Thirdwhat is the problem with n grams againsparse metric problem andyou know it is not very efficient howmany tokens you will create how manygrams you will create right so one gramitself will be very too many tokens 2grams will be too many tokens threegrams will be too many tokens right manytokens will be there so how many you cankeep creating right so this is again asparse metric problem computationproblemas the third technique people move tosomething known as TF IDF okay TF standsfor term frequency and IDF stands forinverse document frequencywhat is the purpose of this particularmechanism is suppose there are two wordsin front of you the two sentences that Ijust mentioned for example just tounderstand simply I will write it hereagainI am playing cricketokay and then he is playing footballif you notice here in these twosentences guys playing word is common inboth these sentences okaybut what differentiates these twosentences the presence of cricket andfootballso in TF IDF the prime agenda is to notlook sentences individually okay so inall these techniques till now you mightbe noticing sentences or documents arelooked individually and these numbersare computedin TF IDF sentences and Corpus is lookedtogether and a differentiator is triedto create here so how the differentiatorwill be created is Words which arecommon across all the documents thesewill be given low weight is okay andWords which is present in only onedocuments these will be given how it ahigh weightage for that particulardocument there is a complete mathematicsbehind it for example if I write hereCricket okay and if I write herefootballokay and if I write here playingand I want to compute TF IDF score ofdocument 1 and document 2 then indocument 1 the TF IDF score for Cricketwill be high in document 2 the TF IDFscore for football will be highthe playing score in both thesedocuments will be very very low or zerothe reason for that is playing is acommon word in both these documents andthe differentiator is cricket andfootball so their numbers will be highthere is a complete mathematics behindit if you want to go in more detail guysagain I will refer you to the sameplaylist that I was mentioning and hereyou can go and see feature extractiontechniques from bag of words to TF IDFcount vectorizer and TF IDF and I havedone one use case also using tfidf so itwill be very easy for you to understandfrom here all the mathematics I haveexplained there okay so now what ishappening now entire Corpus peoplepeople started looking together and tryto understand the meaning of words andcompute TF IDF TF IDF can be computedfor n gram tokens also not individualtokens suppose I want to compute TF ideafor this or this or this I can very welldo that that is doable okayso up to tfidf at least some somemeaning started coming in the world ofNLP some some things we are able tocapture rightnow tfidf was number three I was justchecking which number I am in and then Iwill go to number four now what isnumber four as it moves forward itbecomes little more interesting let mesee my notes here once which I havenoted at number four at number four wewill learn something about the world ofword embedding the world ofword embedding now one thing to noticehere guys till now we are processingdocument by document if you notice hereall these techniques will go and lookfor word occurrence in a document andcreate a matrix based on thatwhat if I want to process my documentword by word what if I want to processmy machine learning engine word by wordfor example here I have a sentence I amplayingCricket okayso I do not want to process thissentence as a whole rather I want tolearn from word by word so I will treatI first then I will treat M then I willread playing then I will read Cricket sohow would you do that how would you youknow treat word so word needs to beconverted to numbers and those arecalled word vectors okay remember thisterminology guys word vectors wordvectors means what if I create a vectorfrom this wordhow will you create a vector from thiswordone famous technique is known as againone hot encoding one or encodingokayone hot encoding what it will do is itwill simply assign a number to all thewords in your Corpus for example howmany words are there in my Corpus I amplayingCricket let's take first sentence onlyjust to make you understand I am nottaking the second sentence now suppose Iis your word number one aim is your wordnumber two playing is your word numberthree Cricket is your word number fourso if you do a one hot encoding rightthenthis is how your same sentence will looklike one zero zero zero this is yourfirst word try to understand this guythis is the base for everything in RNand lstm and large language models okayone zero zero zero is your first wordthen 0 1 0 0 is your second wordokay because m is number two m is numbertwo right so second word becomes onethird word becomes0 0 1 0 third wordfourth word zero zero zero oneso try to understand don't confuse thisentire thing is your first sentence thisentire thing is your first sentence okayand this is your word one this is yourword two this is your word three andthis is your word four and this iscalled this one zero zero this thing isword Vector this is word Vector this isword vector and this is word vectorso I told you one technique of one hotencodingto encode your numbers word into wordvectorsand from this only the AdvancedTechniques ofword embedding came into picture okay Iam going to show you in Python how theadvanced word embeddings are workingbut one thing I want to tell you herewhen word embeddings came into into thepicture then artificial neural networksstarted gaining lot of attention in theindustry artificial neural networks whybecause it needs lot of processing powerNow understand guysthis looks much simpler if I talk fromprocessing point of view right frommachine point of view processing pointof view if I go document by document itlooks little simpler right but if I goword by word right then my input itselfis becoming very very huge so processingwill become huge and it will need morememory and more complex Network and thatis when the artificial neural networksbecome popular then word embeddings andall these things started taking pictureI started taking you know front seat inthe world of NLP so what is the problemof with word embedding againthis is computationally expensive as Itold you the input will go all togetherin different way now using tensors so ifyou don't know the concept of tensorsguys please read about it it's a veryvery simple topic to understand you cansimply you know if you are a python guyyou can simply think it liken-dimensional array okay ND array inPythonso if there is one value one singlevalue then this is like one one scalarvalue if I write like one two three fourthis is one kind of vector value and Ican write a 2d Vector I can write a 3DVector I can write a n dimensionalVector right so in the world of machinelearning tensors are nothing but you canthink of n dimensional array and wherethat is used is now suppose this thissentence you have to give input to yourtraining rightthis sentence so this sentence itselfhas become a n dimensional array if yousee this right so this has become a ndimensional array so this will be calledas a tensor okay so it will go in inputas a tensor so nothing to confuse theirtensor means input is going in Ndimensional array you have to understandand since artificial neural network cameso these computations became possiblenow if I go one level from here thenthere are different types of wordembedding I I explained you a simpleword embedding technique that is one hotbut there are different types of wordembedding techniques for example what towake is a word embedding technique okayGlobe is another word word embeddingtechnique so what these will do is thiswill give a more meaningful embedding toyour words for example if I take what towake as an example right and if I takeCricket as a word soin normal what one hot encoding it willjust be one zero one zero one zero rightbut this is a pre-trained model what tomake is a pre-trained model and Globe isalso a pre-trained model when you take apre-trend model and when you embed yourmachine learning model your data rightso it will be featured on some of theother dimensions for exampleis a game is outdoor okay is outdooris multiplayer I'm writing here somefeatures on these features your wordwill be given as score so Cricket is agame so 0.9 score out of oneis an outdoor game 0.8 score out of oneis multiplayer game 0.9 score out of oneso this becomes your vector I am justwriting here three it can be a 300 or3000 Vector Dimension vector so I amwriting herenot Dimension objects you know presenceof elements in the vector so 0.9 0.8 0.9this is your vector Cricket okay anotherword comes one more Vector getsgenerated so if you compare from yournormal 114 coding right then that thatlooks little more meaningful okay sothat is one kind of Advance you can sayword embedding technique if you comparelike you know some time backbut I am going to show you in Pythonin Keras right in Keras which is whichis a deep learning framework it givesyou its own embedding layer okay itgives you its own embedding layer inKeras so what you can do is this is afamous deep learning frameworkin Keras you can simply say that this ismy Vector this is my document embed mydocument and you can just get yourembedding done I and there is one moreembedding that I will show you in Pythonnow that is known as integer basedencoding that is very similar to what wesaw in one hot encoding okay integerbased encoding so try to understand guyshow things are improving in the world ofNLP I am going to python now and showyou how these things are workingtogetherjust a quick revisionall these things we have understood howthe NLP has improved right from countvectorizer counting the number of wordshere in place of one zero you can alsowrite count of the word okay that iscounting the number of wordsthen problems with this then the worldof engrams then what happened in TF IDFand then how the word embedding cameinto picture so converting what twovectors came into picture somesophisticated way of converting what twovectors came into picture and then let'sgo to Python and see what are differentembedding techniques that I want to showyouso here guys I have taken these twolines as you can see import numpy SNP myCorpus so what is my Corpus my Corpus issimply combination of those twosentences that I am writing I am playingCricket he is playing football this ismy two documents or two sentences thatyou can see here I will say enterfrom Keras dot preprocessing I amimporting tokenizer now some of you whois not aware of any concept of deeplearning or neural network you have togo to unfold data science deep learningand write from intuition behind neuralnetwork you will find all the video tilloptimizers in neural network okayso everything that I will speak fromhere on if you have any confusionsplease go and see this playlist 15videos all these are very very usefulfor you okayso going back toKeras is a famous deep learningframework I will say here from Keras Iam importing preprocessing dot textand I am sayingI am initializing a tokenizer objecttokenizer object means it will tokenizemy my Corpusand then I am calling a method calledfit on text and then if you see hereguys whatever I am highlighting rightthe the fit on text has given one numberto all the words in my Corpus so playingis my word number one I is my wordnumber two m is my word number threeCricket is my word number four he is myword number fiveis six football seven so as I wastelling you in a theory rightif you see here he is H is capital herebut in the token at least small how thatbecomes small because Keras itself didsome pre-processing on my text try tounderstand this Keras itself did somepre-processing on my text and convertedeverything to lowercase and assigned anumber at the moment my words areassigned one one number right and thenif I run text to sequences rightthen you will see that my my originaldocument are these two okay so my firstmy first document is I am playingcricketand my second document is he is playingfootballokayso I is which number word I it's secondnumber word so two okay you can see herethese two words are represented in termsof integers now these two sentencesso two three one four means I am playingcricket2 is i m is 3 playing is one Cricket isfour so two three one four is my firstsentenceokay five six one seven same way is mysecond sentence he is playing footballhe is five is six playingone and football seven so what I havedone here is I have imported a pythonpackage from Keras and I have convertedmy text to numbers using something knownas integer embedding this is called as ainteger embedding all your words will begiven one one integer numberand your sentence will be converted likethis very similar to one hot encodingjust that numbers are here integernumbers are here okayso if we move from here the othertechnique the other word embeddingtechnique that I want to show you comesdirectly from Keras Keras will embed itfor you so if I go here anduh I am just creating a pad sequencewhichwhich I am creating for for some purposeI will come back to this later butbefore that guys here as you can seeimport tensorflow I am importingembedding layer and then flatten anddense and simple adenine M lot usingdon't worry about all thisif you seemost of these things I'm not usingwhatever I'm highlighting okay just I'musing sequential model and I am usingembedding layer so as you can see justfocus on line number six seven and eightwhatever I am highlighting herefrom Keras I am taking a sequentiallayerand then I am adding a embeddingembedding means I want to embed my inputand then I am saying it why I'm saying 8because there are seven unique words inmy vocab how many unique words are therein my vocab seven unique words in myvocab so in Keras embedding you have togive n Plus 1. so 8 output Dimension Iwant three and input length is fourinput length is what is the length of mymy each sentence so here in this boxwhat I am doing is I'm just padding sowhat is the concept of padding I willtell yousuppose Suppose there are two sentencesone is i m and other is i mAman okay so when you send when youconvert this sentence to integerencoding or any kind of encoding rightsuppose this will have 15 and M is let'ssay 16 number word so this is theinteger encoding for this rightand here suppose 15 and then 16 and thena money is let's say 17. so this Vectoris of size 3 and this Vector is of sizesorry this Vector is of size 2 and thisis of size 3. I don't want that tohappen because that will create problemin my machine learning so I want boththese vectors to be same size for makingit same size there is a concept ofpadding so what padding will do is itwill add 0 just to make it a fixednumber for example I say make it paddingis equal to 0 and add 0 in pre pre meansbefore this or post means after this sothen I will get two vectors15 16 0 this is my first sentence and 1516 and 17 this is my second sentenceokay so this is padding what paddingdoes it makes your vectors equal size byadding zeros in front or in the back sothat is what I am doing here from Kerasutils import pad sequences and I amsaying if some word is not in the sameuh word if if sum is not in the same youknow length then convert that to samelength but in this case both my wordsare four four four numbers only so thisis fine this will not do anythingnow what I am doing I am the same thingI am giving here input length is equalto 4. so what I'm asking to Keras istake these input okay take these inputand give me an output of threedimensions so let's come back to our ourhere againso now what we have iswe have words okay and in our words wehave how many how many vocab seven vocabseven is myvocab size vocab size means how manyunique words are there in your vocab soif you come here right one two threefour five six seven seven unique wordsin my vocabso when the vector will be created onehot encoded Vector will be created thenit will be created how many entries willbe there for example suppose for Cricketwhat I want to create a one hot encodedvector so how many elements will be herethere will be seven elements right sevenelements so first element will representI second M like that okay so onlyCricket will be one rest all will bezero so what I am saying is 7 is myvocab size so when my model will getcreated the embedding model it will looklike this one two three four five sixsevenokay and then I am saying outputDimension will be three output Dimensionwill be three means one two and threewill be my output so what I want to do Iwant to create a fully connected neuralnetwork herefully connected neural network herewhere I am saying to Keras embeddingthat take my word suppose my Cricketword looks like this one zero zero zerozero zero zero seven one two three fourfive six seven so suppose my Cricketword looks like thisnow do not confuse between these numbersand this encoded number so this is wordnumber two for example my is word numbertwo so this encoding will happeninternally otherwise it cannot send itto the vector space okay so thisencoding will happen internallywhat you have here is one number foreach word okay so one two three fourfive six seven suppose we are talkingabout two word number two right so thatword number two will become one restwill become zero this goes as input toyour embedding layer or this model inthis case and what I am saying to Kerasis give me a three dimension outputthree dimension output is encode my wordin a three dimension space so threedimension space meansit will be a D1 and D2 and D3 so my wordCricket my word Cricket will have somescore on these three so this score canbe let's say 0.6 minus 0.4 and 0.2similarly my word footballmy word football can have a score of 0.5on this 0.2 and 0.1 something like thiswhat I am saying to Keras is take all mywords one by one Words which are encodedin integer format remember this integerformat words will be converted to onehot vectors before sending it to themodel so two number word only this placewill become one rest all will becomezero that will be sent and the outputwhat you get is a three dimension outputokay so if I run this model hereand if I predict for example I amcompiling this model and I am predictingon my padded sequence my padded sequencein same input data I am predicting onokayif I am predicting on my padded sequencethat is same input data what you willnotice here is now my word number2 my word number 2 is represented bythisthis is my word number twookay please pay attention here guysmy word number twowent to the model learned the embeddingand with when it came back afterembedding it is represented like thisokay similarly the next word isrepresented like this so all the wordsin my padded sequence which was there onwhich model was trained only okay hasbeen converted into a three dimensionalnumbers now your original sentence youroriginal sentence these two sentencesarethese three dimensional numbers now nowyou can take these numbers you can trainyour model and do whatever you want okaybefore I train my model I will explainyou one more time what has been doneherethis is your original sentencefrom your original sentence what you didyou created tokens tokens Missindividual words in those individualwords you assigned a number for exampleplaying is first word I is second wordaim is third word and so on and so forthonce this happened then you said okaycreate a sequence from my Corpusnow the first sentence has beenconverted to a series of numbers becauseyou know now system identifies that as anumber so I is number two m is numberthree playing is number one and Cricketis number four okaynow what I want to do is I want to takeadvantage of Keras embedding layer sowhen I want to send this to Kerasembedding for one more layer ofembeddingthen if I send this my sequences rightthen it will get converted into a onehot Vector all these words will beconverted into one hot vector and thosewill be predicted based on Kerasembedding so when the embedding resultscomes out for all the word I will havethree three numbers that I am trying toshow you there for all the words threethree numbersokayfor all the words three three numbersone two three number four first word onetwo three number four fourth word and soon and so forth I can take this data andtrain a model let's do that so till nowif you notice I have not defined mytarget variableI am solving this as a classificationproblem okayso here what I'm trying to do I amtrying tofrom numpy import I am importing anarray and I am calling sentence level isequal to array one zero array one zeromeans I am trying to predict if a givensentence falls in the category ofcricket so one means Cricket zero meansno Cricket Okay soI am giving 1 0 I will call this as ismy sentence models okay now if you seehere I am again taking sequential I amadding same with the embedding layerthat that I was doing aboveand then I'm adding a flattening layerand this is a very simple basic neuralnetwork if you have confusions you canwatch you know components of neuralnetwork video it will be very very clearto you what I am doing here very simpleneural networkand sigmoid because this is aclassification problem so training thisneural networkhere if you see I am taking a newsentencehe is playing football okayand this new sentence has been convertedinto a sequence using same token Azurethat we did above so if you see herethe same tokenizer that we used above mytokenizer right using this tokenizeronlyI have converted my sentence intosentence sequenceand then I have added because I want toensure it's a free four four thing fourcharacter thingand then I have predicted and if you cansee here my prediction is 0 0 means itisnot Cricket because my input line hereiswhat is my input line heremy input line here is it is footballokayso what I did in this model up to here Icreated my text into numbers then Iadded a label because I did not had inthe beginningand then I defined a neural networkmodel with one just one embedding layerone flattened layer and Target is densebecause this is a sigmoid because thisis a binary classification problem Icompiled my modelandI just fit my model and I am predictingwith a new sentence my new sentence ishe's playing football on this newsentence I am predicting when I ampredicting I am getting my prediction aszero zero because this is not a cricketrelated word okayand here all the pre-processing that Iam doing it is based on thepre-processing what I did in thetraining dataso what is this is a simpleclassification problem that is solved infront of you using simple most basicneural network okay most basic neuralnetwork using thatI solved a simple classification problemnowmy question to you first question to youwhich I want you to write me in commentiswhy total number of parameters and totalnumber of trainable parameters is 24here that is the first thing that youhave to write me in comment okay thinkon that and write me if you understandthe neural network architecture you willbe easily able to explain me why that is24 only why not something else okayyou have to explain me in the commentthen second thing that I want to capturehere I want to go back there and try toexplain you that we have coveredeverything up to word embedding okay sowhich means that we have coveredeverything up to whatever happenedbefore the world of RNNso why RNN came into picture what is theuse of RNN we have all these techniquesthen why RNN has come into pictureso I will write here one wordokay one sentence and then we will thinktogether for example I write hereI wasI wasborninGermanyI was born in Germanyand henceand hencecanspeakblankso what do you think will be here in theblankobviously you and me are human so we cansimply think it will be German okaybecause somebody is born in Germany sohe or she can speak German how did youcome to that conclusionbecause whatever was written before thisusing this memory rightyou went backwards and you understoodwhat was said before what was saidbefore is I was born in Germanyokay and this information I was born inGermany was useful in determining whatwill be the next word or in other wayyou can say in useful in understandingthe context of a given line or sentenceokayin none of these models in none of thesemodels that we have discussed till nowwhatever kind of word embedding we havedone whatever kind of advancement wehave donetill now we don't have capacity andcapability of remembering what happenedbefore for examplein this sentence there are four wordsokay in integer based encoding or anyencoding you do rightall these words will goand all these words will you knowprediction will happen so one ndimensional array will get created One ndimensional array will get created whichwe call tensors alsothat will go as the input in any neuralnetwork and output will come and thenthe loss will be optimized that is howit will work but there is no way theprevious information can be captured orstored or memorized what is meant byprevious information is in this casesuppose the the sentence is I am AmanI goes as a word Vector aim goes asanother word Vector Aman goes as anotherword vectorbut there is no way in a normalartificial neural network that I canremember when I when I reach Aman firstof all all these things will beprocessed together only so there is nono time to reach something okay butsuppose when I reach Aman I don't haveany information about what was beforeRamanand if you don't have this informationwhat was before amand then you knowunderstanding what can happen after thator understand the completecontext of that becomes very verydifficult that is one problem with allthese approaches that we have done tillnowwhat is the other problemso I am writing another word here forexample I say I wasI was walkingI was walkingonon Bankof riverokayor this is one my favorite I will takeokay so for example I can say I work atAppleokay and here I say I eat applenow based on the context right themeaning of word apple is changing a lotso another example of how the contextbased on the context the meaning of thesentence and word changes and then thereare some sentences where there isconfusion there is a referentialambiguity you don't understand what thissentence is for examplechickenisreadyto eat now whether chicken is ready toeat something or chicken is cooked toeat we don't know that sounderstanding the sarcasm understandingthe the context of a saying sentence ina given given scenario right all thesethings can be possible only when youremember the previous words in thenetwork so scientists and researchershad to find out a way to remember whathappened before remember what was saidbefore and keep that information in thenetworkso that by looking at that informationyou know the better predictions can bemade and that is wherethe born you know the new type of neuralnetworks was Bond and that is known asrecurrent neural network or R and N okayso that is where the new type of neuralnetwork was born in 2014 especially forsequential data so whatever data I keptI discussed now came into the categoryof sequential data for example asentence right I am Aman okayleavinglivinginDash testsso if somebody knows where Aman livesthey can fill this sentence so this is akind of sequential data where next thingdepends on previous thing and next thinghas relation from the previous thingokay and suppose you want to predictstock market data so maybe maybe somestock price is let's say 1200 1250 12 30and then 1180 and then 11 20 and then 1215 so what will be the next predictionit will depend on the previous value sothis this kind of data is calledsequential data so to solve the problemof sequential data and to memorize theinformation there was this architectureBond RNNand another variant of RNA is lstmso I am going to cover in my next videothe architecture of RNN and how RNNworks and how it is used in the Deeplearning and in sequence models and thenwe will go on to the advanced topicsokayso what you have to do guys I showed youtwo playlists here one is artificialneural network Basics if you don't knowBasics it will not be easy for you tounderstand Advanced topics okay so justgo through this and understand thebasics welland NLP Basics like data cleaning orword embedding or what vectors and thesethings I covered but again go here andsee which videos you want to see andwhich videos make sense for you watchthose videos okayjust to recap what all we covered todayis a brief history of NLP till RNN okaydifferent techniques from the beginningword from wordcon to TF IDF to n gramdiagrams right toward embeddings twodifferent types of word embedding andthen why what embedding is not thatgreat and what is what are the problemswith word embedding what is padding andI showed you a sentiment analysis hugecase of word embedding using very verysimple sentiment analysis use case usinginteger embedding Keras embedding wesolve that huge caseso please let me know what are yourquestions and how how did you like thisvideo guys as always your comments aremy motivation so please keep commentingand you know press like if you like

Video script SPEAKER 1: Unless you've
been living under a rock,you've probably heard
that AI is gettingvery good at conversation.In fact, maybe you
even chatted with oneof these AI's through a chat
bot interface like Google Bard.SPEAKER 2: This is all
thanks to a powerful kindof neural network called a
Large Language Model, or LLM.LLMs enable computers to
understand and generatelanguage better
than ever before,unlocking a whole host
of new applications.SPEAKER 1: In this
video, we're goingto talk about what LLMs
are and how anyone can getstarted building with them,
whether you're a developeror not.SPEAKER 2: Ready?BOTH: Let's dive in.SPEAKER 1: LLMs are
machine learning modelsthat are really good at
understanding and generatinghuman language.They're based on transformers,
a type of neural networkarchitecture invented by Google.Now, what made the transformer
architecture so powerfulwas its ability to
scale effectively,allowing us to train these
models on massive textdatasets.SPEAKER 2: That's where the
"large" in large languagemodels comes from--both the size and complexity
of the neural network itself,as well as the size of the
dataset that it was trained on.For some of these
models, we're talkingabout trillions of
tokens from a bunchof publicly available sources.And it wasn't until
researchers startedto make these
models really largeand train them on
these huge datasetsthat they started showing
these impressive results,like understanding complex,
nuanced language and generatinglanguage more
eloquently than ever.SPEAKER 1: If you're already
familiar with machine learning,you probably think
about traininga model for a
specific task, like isthis tweet positive or
negative, or translate this textfrom French to English.What makes LLMs
especially powerfulis that one model can be used
for a whole variety of tasks,like chat, copywriting,
translation, summarization,brainstorming, code generation,
and a whole lot more.SPEAKER 2: Best of all, you can
prototype language applicationsincredibly fast with LLMs--in just minutes,
rather than months.And you don't have to be
a machine learning expertto do it.All you really need to
know is how to write.So how do you
actually use an LLM?Well, let's take a look.LLMs learn about
patterns and languagefrom the massive amounts of
text data they're trained on.Then they take as
input some textand produce some output text
that's likely to follow.SPEAKER 1: Another
way to say thisis that LLMs are like really
sophisticated autocomplete.So for example, if we
give an LLM the input--SPEAKER 2: It's
raining cats and--SPEAKER 1: It'll probably
predict that "dogs" isthe most likely word to follow.Now, this might not
seem that exciting,but we can actually use this
autocomplete-like functionalityto solve tons of tasks just by
writing strategic text input.SPEAKER 2: For example,
let's take Google's PaLMLLM and input this sentence.SPEAKER 1: I have two
apples and I eat one.I'm left with--SPEAKER 2: The PaLM model
outputs the answer "one."In this way, we get the LLM
to perform some simple math.SPEAKER 1: Or take
another example.SPEAKER 2: Paris is to
France as Tokyo is to--SPEAKER 1: The PaLM model
outputs "Japan," which tells usthat the model can not
only complete analogies,but it also has some
world knowledge that it'slearned from its training data.So I should add the
caveat that not allof the knowledge
that the LLM outputsis necessarily
factually accurate.SPEAKER 2: Now, all of the
text that we feed into an LLMas input is called a
prompt, and it turns outthere's this whole art known
as prompt design, whichis about figuring out
how to write and formatprompt text to get LLMs
to do what you want.SPEAKER 1: For example,
one way to structurea prompt is as an
instruction, like--SPEAKER 2: Write me a
poem about Ada Lovelacein the style of Shakespeare.SPEAKER 1: Or explain quantum
physics to me like I'm five.SPEAKER 2: Or generate
a list of itemsI need for a camping trip
to Yosemite National Park.SPEAKER 1: This approach--
using a single commandto get an LLM to
take on a behavior--is called zero shot learning.But in addition to just
providing an instruction,it can be helpful to
show the model whatyou want by adding examples.This is called few shot
learning because we showedthe model a few examples.Like here's a prompt for
translating from Englishto French.First we provide an instruction.Then we give some examples,
establishing the text pattern.If we pass this prompt
to an LLM like PaLM,we get back something
like the following.SPEAKER 2: The model did
provide a French translationof lipstick, but you might
notice that it went onto generate all these additional
English-French translationpairs.This might seem a
little unexpected,but the LLM is just
completing the patternthat we gave it in the prompt.As another example,
here's a few shotprompt to convert Python
code snippets to JavaScript.Our prompt starts
with an instruction,then we have some examples,
and finally, the Python codewe actually want converted.The very last part
of this promptis JavaScript colon
because we wantto nudge the model to output
some JavaScript code justlike this.SPEAKER 1: Note that
in a real application,we probably want to parameterize
the input instead of hardcoding it into the prompt.That way, our users can
provide the Python codethat they want converted.And this is essentially how
you would customize an LLMfor a Python to JavaScript app.SPEAKER 2: Now, you
might be wonderingwhat the absolute best way
to write a model prompt is.And if so, we've got
some bad news for you.SPEAKER 1: There's
currently no optimal wayto write model
prompts, and that'sbecause the results we get
are so highly dependenton the underlying model.Sometimes small changes in
wording or even in word ordercan improve the LLM's outputs
in ways that are not alwayspredictable.SPEAKER 2: That's
why it's always worthtrying out lots of different
structures and examplesand formats and seeing what
works best for your use case.SPEAKER 1: There you have it.That's the magic of
LLMs in a nutshell.SPEAKER 2: You can check
out Bard at bard.google.com,and definitely let us
know in the commentsbelow what you're
building with LLMs.[MUSIC PLAYING]

Video script [MUSIC PLAYING]DALE MARKOWITZ: The
neat thing about workingin machine learning is that
every few years, somebodyinvents something crazy that
makes you totally reconsiderwhat's possible, like
models that can playGo or generate
hyper-realistic faces.And today, the
mind-blowing discoverythat's rocking
everyone's world isa type of neural network
called a transformer.Transformers are models that
can translate text, writepoems and op-eds, and even
generate computer code.They could be used in biology
to solve the protein foldingproblem.Transformers are like
this magical machinelearning hammer that seems to
make every problem into a nail.If you've heard of the
trendy new ML modelsBERT, or GPT-3, or T5,
all of these modelsare based on transformers.So if you want to stay
hip in machine learningand especially in natural
language processing,you have to know
about the transformer.So in this video,
I'm going to tell youabout what transformers
are, how they work,and why they've
been so impactful.Let's get to it.So what is a transformer?It's a type of neural
network architecture.To recap, neural networks
are a very effective typeof model for analyzing
complicated datatypes, like images,
videos, audio, and text.But there are different types
of neural networks optimizedfor different types of data.Like if you're analyzing
images, you would typicallyuse a convolutional
neural network,which is designed
to vaguely mimicthe way that the human
brain processes vision.And since around
2012, neural networkshave been really good
at solving vision tasks,like identifying
objects in photos.But for a long time, we didn't
have anything comparablygood for analyzing language,
whether for translation,or text summarization,
or text generation.And this is a problem, because
language is the primary waythat humans communicate.You see, until transformers
came around, the waywe used deep learning
to understand textwas with a type of model called
a Recurrent Neural Network,or an RNN, that looked
something like this.Let's say you wanted
to translate a sentencefrom English to French.An RNN would take as
input an English sentenceand process the
words one at a time,and then sequentially spit
out their French counterparts.The keyword here is sequential.In language, the order
of words matters,and you can't just
shuffle them around.For example, the sentence
Jane went looking for troublemeans something very different
than the sentence Troublewent looking for Jane.So any model that's going
to deal with languagehas to capture word order,
and recurrent neural networksdo this by looking at one
word at a time sequentially.But RNNs had a lot of problems.First, they never
really did wellat handling large sequences
of text, like long paragraphsor essays.By the time they were analyzing
the end of a paragraph,they'd forget what
happened in the beginning.And even worse, RNNs were
pretty hard to train.Because they process
words sequentially,they couldn't
paralellize well, whichmeans that you couldn't just
speed them up by throwinglots of GPUs at them.And when you have a model
that's slow to train,you can't train it on
all that much data.This is where the transformer
changed everything.They're a model developed in
2017 by researchers at Googleand the University of Toronto,
and they were initiallydesigned to do translation.But unlike recurrent
neural networks,you could really efficiently
paralellize transformers.And that meant that
with the right hardware,you could train some
really big models.How big?Really big.Remember GPT-3, that model
that writes poetry and code,and has conversations?That was trained on almost
45 terabytes of text data,including almost the
entire public web.[WHISTLES] So if you remember
anything about transformers,let it be this.Combine a model that scales
really well with a huge dataset and the results will
probably blow your mind.So how do these
things actually work?From the diagram in the paper,
it should be pretty clear.Or maybe not.Actually, it's simpler
than you might think.There are three main
innovations thatmake this model work so well.Positional encodings and
attention, and specifically,a type of attention
called self-attention.Let's start by talking
about the first one,positional encodings.Let's say we're trying
to translate textfrom English to French.Positional encodings is
the idea that insteadof looking at
words sequentially,you take each word
in your sentence,and before you feed it
into the neural network,you slap a number on it--1, 2, 3, depending
on what numberthe word is in the sentence.In other words, you
store informationabout word order
in the data itself,rather than in the
structure of the network.Then as you train the
network on lots of text data,it learns how to interpret
those positional encodings.In this way, the neural
network learns the importanceof word order from the data.This is a high level
way to understandpositional encodings,
but it's an innovationthat really helped make
transformers easierto train than RNNs.The next innovation
in this paperis a concept called
attention, whichyou'll see used everywhere in
machine learning these days.In fact, the title of the
original transformer paperis "Attention Is All You Need."So the agreement on the
European economic areawas signed in August 1992.Did you know that?That's the example sentence
given in the original paper.And remember, the
original transformerwas designed for translation.Now imagine trying to translate
that sentence to French.One bad way to translate text
is to try to translate each wordone for one.But in French, some
words are flipped,like in the French translation,
European comes before economic.Plus, French is a
language that has genderedagreement between words.So the word [FRENCH] needs
to be in the feminine formto match with [FRENCH].The attention mechanism is
a neural network structurethat allows a text model to
look at every single wordin the original
sentence when makinga decision about how to
translate a word in the outputsentence.In fact, here's a
nice visualizationfrom that paper that shows what
words in the input sentencethe model is
attending to when itmakes predictions about a
word for the output sentence.So when the model outputs
the word [FRENCH],,it's looking at the input
words European and economic.You can think of this
diagram as a sortof heat map for attention.And how does the
model know which wordsit should be attending to?It's something that's
learned over time from data.By seeing thousands of examples
of French and English sentencepairs, the model
learns about gender,and word order, and
plurality, and allof that grammatical stuff.So we talked about two key
transformer innovations,positional encoding
and attention.But actually, attention had
been invented before this paper.The real innovation in
transformers was somethingcalled self-attention, a twist
on traditional attention.The type of attention
we just talked abouthad to do with aligning
words in English and French,which is really important
for translation.But what if you're just
trying to understandthe underlying meaning
in language so that youcan build a network that can do
any number of language tasks?What's incredible
about neural networks,like transformers, is that as
they analyze tons of text data,they begin to build up this
internal representationor understanding of
language automatically.They might learn, for example,
that the words programmer,and software engineer,
and software developerare all synonymous.And they might also naturally
learn the rules of grammar,and gender, and
tense, and so on.The better this internal
representation of languagethe neural network
learns, the better itwill be at any language task.And it turns out that attention
can be a very effective wayto get a neural network
to understand languageif it's turned on the
input text itself.Let me give you an example.Take these two sentences--Server, can I have the check?Versus, Looks like I
just crashed the server.The word server here means
two very different things.And I know that,
because I'm lookingat the context of the
surrounding words.Self-attention allows
a neural networkto understand a word in the
context of the words around it.So when a model
processes the word serverin the first
sentence, it might beattending to the
word check, whichhelps it disambiguate from a
human server versus a mail one.In the second
sentence, the modelmight be attending to the
word crashed to determinethat the server is a machine.Self-attention can also
help neural networksdisambiguate words,
recognize parts of speech,and even identify word tense.This, in a nutshell, is the
value of self-attention.So to summarize,
transformers boil downto positional encodings,
attention, and self-attention.Of course, this is a 10,000-foot
look at transformers.But how are they
actually useful?One of the most popular
transformer-based modelsis called BERT, which was
invented just around the timethat I joined Google in 2018.BERT was trained on
a massive text corpusand has become this sort
of general pocketknifefor NLP that can be adapted
to a bunch of different tasks,like text summarization,
question answering,classification, and
finding similar sentences.It's used in Google Search to
help understand search queries,and it powers a lot of
Google Cloud's NLP tools,like Google Cloud
AutoML Natural Language.BERT also proved that you
could build very good modelson unlabeled data,
like text scrapedfrom Wikipedia or Reddit.This is called
semi-supervised learning,and it's a big trend in
machine learning right now.So if I've sold you about
how cool transformers are,you might want to start
using them in your app.No problem.TensorFlow Hub is a great place
to grab pretrained transformermodels, like BERT.You can download them for
free in multiple languageand drop them straight
into your app.You can also check out the
popular transformers Pythonlibrary, built by the
company Hugging Face.That's one of the
community's favorite waysto train and use
transformer models.For more transformer

Video script The initials GPT stand for Generative Pretrained Transformer.So that first word is straightforward enough, these are bots that generate new text.Pretrained refers to how the model went through a process of learning from a massive amount of data, and the prefix insinuates that there's more room to fine-tune it on specific tasks with additional training.But the last word, that's the real key piece.A transformer is a specific kind of neural network, a machine learning model, and it's the core invention underlying the current boom in AI.What I want to do with this video and the following chapters is go through a visually-driven explanation for what actually happens inside a transformer.We're going to follow the data that flows through it and go step by step.There are many different kinds of models that you can build using transformers.Some models take in audio and produce a transcript.This sentence comes from a model going the other way around, producing synthetic speech just from text.All those tools that took the world by storm in 2022 like Dolly and Midjourney that take in a text description and produce an image are based on transformers.Even if I can't quite get it to understand what a pie creature is supposed to be, I'm still blown away that this kind of thing is even remotely possible.And the original transformer introduced in 2017 by Google was invented for the specific use case of translating text from one language into another.But the variant that you and I will focus on, which is the type that underlies tools like ChatGPT, will be a model that's trained to take in a piece of text, maybe even with some surrounding images or sound accompanying it, and produce a prediction for what comes next in the passage.That prediction takes the form of a probability distribution over many different chunks of text that might follow.At first glance, you might think that predicting the next word feels like a very different goal from generating new text.But once you have a prediction model like this, a simple thing you generate a longer piece of text is to give it an initial snippet to work with, have it take a random sample from the distribution it just generated, append that sample to the text, and then run the whole process again to make a new prediction based on all the new text, including what it just added.I don't know about you, but it really doesn't feel like this should actually work.In this animation, for example, I'm running GPT-2 on my laptop and having it repeatedly predict and sample the next chunk of text to generate a story based on the seed text.The story just doesn't really make that much sense.But if I swap it out for API calls to GPT-3 instead, which is the same basic model, just much bigger, suddenly almost magically we do get a sensible story, one that even seems to infer that a pi creature would live in a land of math and computation.This process here of repeated prediction and sampling is essentially what's happening when you interact with ChatGPT or any of these other large language models and you see them producing one word at a time.In fact, one feature that I would very much enjoy is the ability to see the underlying distribution for each new word that it chooses.Let's kick things off with a very high level preview of how data flows through a transformer.We will spend much more time motivating and interpreting and expanding on the details of each step, but in broad strokes, when one of these chatbots generates a given word, here's what's going on under the hood.First, the input is broken up into a bunch of little pieces.These pieces are called tokens, and in the case of text these tend to be words or little pieces of words or other common character combinations.If images or sound are involved, then tokens could be little patches of that image or little chunks of that sound.Each one of these tokens is then associated with a vector, meaning some list of numbers, which is meant to somehow encode the meaning of that piece.If you think of these vectors as giving coordinates in some very high dimensional space, words with similar meanings tend to land on vectors that are close to each other in that space.This sequence of vectors then passes through an operation that's known as an attention block, and this allows the vectors to talk to each other and pass information back and forth to update their values.For example, the meaning of the word model in the phrase a machine learning model is different from its meaning in the phrase a fashion model.The attention block is what's responsible for figuring out which words in context are relevant to updating the meanings of which other words, and how exactly those meanings should be updated.And again, whenever I use the word meaning, this is somehow entirely encoded in the entries of those vectors.After that, these vectors pass through a different kind of operation, and depending on the source that you're reading this will be referred to as a multi-layer perceptron or maybe a feed-forward layer.And here the vectors don't talk to each other, they all go through the same operation in parallel.And while this block is a little bit harder to interpret, later on we'll talk about how the step is a little bit like asking a long list of questions about each vector, and then updating them based on the answers to those questions.All of the operations in both of these blocks look like a giant pile of matrix multiplications, and our primary job is going to be to understand how to read the underlying matrices.I'm glossing over some details about some normalization steps that happen in between, but this is after all a high-level preview.After that, the process essentially repeats, you go back and forth between attention blocks and multi-layer perceptron blocks, until at the very end the hope is that all of the essential meaning of the passage has somehow been baked into the very last vector in the sequence.We then perform a certain operation on that last vector that produces a probability distribution over all possible tokens, all possible little chunks of text that might come next.And like I said, once you have a tool that predicts what comes next given a snippet of text, you can feed it a little bit of seed text and have it repeatedly play this game of predicting what comes next, sampling from the distribution, appending it, and then repeating over and over.Some of you in the know may remember how long before ChatGPT came into the scene, this is what early demos of GPT-3 looked like, you would have it autocomplete stories and essays based on an initial snippet.To make a tool like this into a chatbot, the easiest starting point is to have a little bit of text that establishes the setting of a user interacting with a helpful AI assistant, what you would call the system prompt, and then you would use the user's initial question or prompt as the first bit of dialogue, and then you have it start predicting what such a helpful AI assistant would say in response.There is more to say about an step of training that's required to make this work well, but at a high level this is the idea.In this chapter, you and I are going to expand on the details of what happens at the very beginning of the network, at the very end of the network, and I also want to spend a lot of time reviewing some important bits of background knowledge, things that would have been second nature to any machine learning engineer by the time transformers came around.If you're comfortable with that background knowledge and a little impatient, you could feel free to skip to the next chapter, which is going to focus on the attention blocks, generally considered the heart of the transformer.After that I want to talk more about these multi-layer perceptron blocks, how training works, and a number of other details that will have been skipped up to that point.For broader context, these videos are additions to a mini-series about deep learning, and it's okay if you haven't watched the previous ones, I think you can do it out of order, but before diving into transformers specifically, I do think it's worth making sure that we're on the same page about the basic premise and structure of deep learning.At the risk of stating the obvious, this is one approach to machine learning, which describes any model where you're using data to somehow determine how a model behaves.What I mean by that is, let's say you want a function that takes in an image and it produces a label describing it, or our example of predicting the next word given a passage of text, or any other task that seems to require some element of intuition and pattern recognition.We almost take this for granted these days, but the idea with machine learning is that rather than trying to explicitly define a procedure for how to do that task in code, which is what people would have done in the earliest days of AI, instead you set up a very flexible structure with tunable parameters, like a bunch of knobs and dials, and then somehow you use many examples of what the output should look like for a given input to tweak and tune the values of those parameters to mimic this behavior.For example, maybe the simplest form of machine learning is linear regression, where your inputs and outputs are each single numbers, something like the square footage of a house and its price, and what you want is to find a line of best fit through this data, you know, to predict future house prices.That line is described by two continuous parameters, say the slope and the y-intercept, and the goal of linear regression is to determine those parameters to closely match the data.Needless to say, deep learning models get much more complicated.GPT-3, for example, has not two, but 175 billion parameters.But here's the thing, it's not a given that you can create some giant model with a huge number of parameters without it either grossly overfitting the training data or being completely intractable to train.Deep learning describes a class of models that in the last couple decades have proven to scale remarkably well.What unifies them is the same training algorithm, called backpropagation, and the context I want you to have as we go in is that in order for this training algorithm to work well at scale, these models have to follow a certain specific format.If you know this format going in, it helps to explain many of the choices for how a transformer processes language, which otherwise run the risk of feeling arbitrary.First, whatever model you're making, the input has to be formatted as an array of real numbers.This could mean a list of numbers, it could be a two-dimensional array, or very often you deal with higher dimensional arrays, where the general term used is tensor.You often think of that input data as being progressively transformed into many distinct layers, where again, each layer is always structured as some kind of array of real numbers, until you get to a final layer which you consider the output.For example, the final layer in our text processing model is a list of numbers representing the probability distribution for all possible next tokens.In deep learning, these model parameters are almost always referred to as weights, and this is because a key feature of these models is that the only way these parameters interact with the data being processed is through weighted sums.You also sprinkle some non-linear functions throughout, but they won't depend on parameters.Typically though, instead of seeing the weighted sums all naked and written out explicitly like this, you'll instead find them packaged together as various components in a matrix vector product.It amounts to saying the same thing, if you think back to how matrix vector multiplication works, each component in the output looks like a weighted sum.It's just often conceptually cleaner for you and me to think about matrices that are filled with tunable parameters that transform vectors that are drawn from the data being processed.For example, those 175 billion weights in GPT-3 are organized into just under 28,000 distinct matrices.Those matrices in turn fall into eight different categories, and what you and I are going to do is step through each one of those categories to understand what that type does.As we go through, I think it's kind of fun to reference the specific numbers from GPT-3 to count up exactly where those 175 billion come from.Even if nowadays there are bigger and better models, this one has a certain charm as the large-language model to really capture the world's attention outside of ML communities.Also, practically speaking, companies tend to keep much tighter lips around the specific numbers for more modern networks.I just want to set the scene going in, that as you peek under the hood to see what happens inside a tool like ChatGPT, almost all of the actual computation looks like matrix vector multiplication.There's a little bit of a risk getting lost in the sea of billions of numbers, but you should draw a very sharp distinction in your mind between the weights of the model, which I'll always color in blue or red, and the data being processed, which I'll always color in gray.The weights are the actual brains, they are the things learned during training, and they determine how it behaves.The data being processed simply encodes whatever specific input is fed into the model for a given run, like an example snippet of text.With all of that as foundation, let's dig into the first step of this text processing example, which is to break up the input into little chunks and turn those chunks into vectors.I mentioned how those chunks are called tokens, which might be pieces of words or punctuation, but every now and then in this chapter and especially in the next one, I'd like to just pretend that it's broken more cleanly into words.Because we humans think in words, this will just make it much easier to reference little examples and clarify each step.The model has a predefined vocabulary, some list of all possible words, say 50,000 of them, and the first matrix that we'll encounter, known as the embedding matrix, has a single column for each one of these words.These columns are what determines what vector each word turns into in that first step.We label it We, and like all the matrices we see, its values begin random, but they're going to be learned based on data.Turning words into vectors was common practice in machine learning long before transformers, but it's a little weird if you've never seen it before, and it sets the foundation for everything that follows, so let's take a moment to get familiar with it.We often call this embedding a word, which invites you to think of these vectors very geometrically as points in some high dimensional space.Visualizing a list of three numbers as coordinates for points in 3D space would be no problem, but word embeddings tend to be much much higher dimensional.In GPT-3 they have 12,288 dimensions, and as you'll see, it matters to work in a space that has a lot of distinct directions.In the same way that you could take a two-dimensional slice through a 3D space and project all the points onto that slice, for the sake of animating word embeddings that a simple model is giving me, I'm going to do an analogous thing by choosing a three-dimensional slice through this very high dimensional space, and projecting the word vectors down onto that and displaying the results.The big idea here is that as a model tweaks and tunes its weights to determine how exactly words get embedded as vectors during training, it tends to settle on a set of embeddings where directions in the space have a kind of semantic meaning.For the simple word-to-vector model I'm running here, if I run a search for all the words whose embeddings are closest to that of tower, you'll notice how they all seem to give very similar tower-ish vibes.And if you want to pull up some Python and play along at home, this is the specific model that I'm using to make the animations.It's not a transformer, but it's enough to illustrate the idea that directions in the space can carry semantic meaning.A very classic example of this is how if you take the difference between the vectors for woman and man, something you would visualize as a little vector connecting the tip of one to the tip of the other, it's very similar to the difference between king and queen.So let's say you didn't know the word for a female monarch, you could find it by taking king, adding this woman-man direction, and searching for the embeddings closest to that point.At least, kind of.Despite this being a classic example for the model I'm playing with, the true embedding of queen is actually a little farther off than this would suggest, presumably because the way queen is used in training data is not merely a feminine version of king.When I played around, family relations seemed to illustrate the idea much better.The point is, it looks like during training the model found it advantageous to choose embeddings such that one direction in this space encodes gender information.Another example is that if you take the embedding of Italy, and you subtract the embedding of Germany, and add that to the embedding of Hitler, you get something very close to the embedding of Mussolini.It's as if the model learned to associate some directions with Italian-ness, and others with WWII axis leaders.Maybe my favorite example in this vein is how in some models, if you take the difference between Germany and Japan, and add it to sushi, you end up very close to bratwurst.Also in playing this game of finding nearest neighbors, I was pleased to see how close Kat was to both beast and monster.One bit of mathematical intuition that's helpful to have in mind, especially for the next chapter, is how the dot product of two vectors can be thought of as a way to measure how well they align.Computationally, dot products involve multiplying all the corresponding components and then adding the results, which is good, since so much of our computation has to look like weighted sums.Geometrically, the dot product is positive when vectors point in similar directions, it's zero if they're perpendicular, and it's negative whenever they point in opposite directions.For example, let's say you were playing with this model, and you hypothesize that the embedding of cats minus cat might represent a sort of plurality direction in this space.To test this, I'm going to take this vector and compute its dot product against the embeddings of certain singular nouns, and compare it to the dot products with the corresponding plural nouns.If you play around with this, you'll notice that the plural ones do indeed seem to consistently give higher values than the singular ones, indicating that they align more with this direction.It's also fun how if you take this dot product with the embeddings of the words 1, 2, 3, and so on, they give increasing values, so it's as if we can quantitatively measure how plural the model finds a given word.Again, the specifics for how words get embedded is learned using data.This embedding matrix, whose columns tell us what happens to each word, is the first pile of weights in our model.Using the GPT-3 numbers, the vocabulary size specifically is 50,257, and again, technically this consists not of words per se, but of tokens.The embedding dimension is 12,288, and multiplying those tells us this consists of about 617 million weights.Let's go ahead and add this to a running tally, remembering that by the end we should count up to 175 billion.In the case of transformers, you really want to think of the vectors in this embedding space as not merely representing individual words.For one thing, they also encode information about the position of that word, which we'll talk about later, but more importantly, you should think of them as having the capacity to soak in context.A vector that started its life as the embedding of the word king, for example, might progressively get tugged and pulled by various blocks in this network, so that by the end it points in a much more specific and nuanced direction that somehow encodes that it was a king who lived in Scotland, and who had achieved his post after murdering the previous king, and who's being described in Shakespearean language.Think about your own understanding of a given word.The meaning of that word is clearly informed by the surroundings, and sometimes this includes context from a long distance away, so in putting together a model that has the ability to predict what word comes next, the goal is to somehow empower it to incorporate context efficiently.To be clear, in that very first step, when you create the array of vectors based on the input text, each one of those is simply plucked out of the embedding matrix, so initially each one can only encode the meaning of a single word without any input from its surroundings.But you should think of the primary goal of this network that it flows through as being to enable each one of those vectors to soak up a meaning that's much more rich and specific than what mere individual words could represent.The network can only process a fixed number of vectors at a time, known as its context size.For GPT-3 it was trained with a context size of 2048, so the data flowing through the network always looks like this array of 2048 columns, each of which has 12,000 dimensions.This context size limits how much text the transformer can incorporate when it's making a prediction of the next word.This is why long conversations with certain chatbots, like the early versions of ChatGPT, often gave the feeling of the bot kind of losing the thread of conversation as you continued too long.We'll go into the details of attention in due time, but skipping ahead I want to talk for a minute about what happens at the very end.Remember, the desired output is a probability distribution over all tokens that might come next.For example, if the very last word is Professor, and the context includes words like Harry Potter, and immediately preceding we see least favorite teacher, and also if you give me some leeway by letting me pretend that tokens simply look like full words, then a well-trained network that had built up knowledge of Harry Potter would presumably assign a high number to the word Snape.This involves two different steps.The first one is to use another matrix that maps the very last vector in that context to a list of 50,000 values, one for each token in the vocabulary.Then there's a function that normalizes this into a probability distribution, it's called Softmax and we'll talk more about it in just a second, but before that it might seem a little bit weird to only use this last embedding to make a prediction, when after all in that last step there are thousands of other vectors in the layer just sitting there with their own context-rich meanings.This has to do with the fact that in the training process it turns out to be much more efficient if you use each one of those vectors in the final layer to simultaneously make a prediction for what would come immediately after it.There's a lot more to be said about training later on, but I just want to call that out right now.This matrix is called the Unembedding matrix and we give it the label WU.Again, like all the weight matrices we see, its entries begin at random, but they are learned during the training process.Keeping score on our total parameter count, this Unembedding matrix has one row for each word in the vocabulary, and each row has the same number of elements as the embedding dimension.It's very similar to the embedding matrix, just with the order swapped, so it adds another 617 million parameters to the network, meaning our count so far is a little over a billion, a small but not wholly insignificant fraction of the 175 billion we'll end up with in total.As the last mini-lesson for this chapter, I want to talk more about this softmax function, since it makes another appearance for us once we dive into the attention blocks.The idea is that if you want a sequence of numbers to act as a probability distribution, say a distribution over all possible next words, then each value has to be between 0 and 1, and you also need all of them to add up to 1.However, if you're playing the learning game where everything you do looks like matrix-vector multiplication, the outputs you get by default don't abide by this at all.The values are often negative, or much bigger than 1, and they almost certainly don't add up to 1.Softmax is the standard way to turn an arbitrary list of numbers into a valid distribution in such a way that the largest values end up closest to 1, and the smaller values end up very close to 0.That's all you really need to know.But if you're curious, the way it works is to first raise e to the power of each of the numbers, which means you now have a list of positive values, and then you can take the sum of all those positive values and divide each term by that sum, which normalizes it into a list that adds up to 1.You'll notice that if one of the numbers in the input is meaningfully bigger than the rest, then in the output the corresponding term dominates the distribution, so if you were sampling from it you'd almost certainly just be picking the maximizing input.But it's softer than just picking the max in the sense that when other values are similarly large, they also get meaningful weight in the distribution, and everything changes continuously as you continuously vary the inputs.In some situations, like when ChatGPT is using this distribution to create a next word, there's room for a little bit of extra fun by adding a little extra spice into this function, with a constant t thrown into the denominator of those exponents.We call it the temperature, since it vaguely resembles the role of temperature in certain thermodynamics equations, and the effect is that when t is larger, you give more weight to the lower values, meaning the distribution is a little bit more uniform, and if t is smaller, then the bigger values will dominate more aggressively, where in the extreme, setting t equal to zero means all of the weight goes to maximum value.For example, I'll have GPT-3 generate a story with the seed text, once upon a time there was A, but I'll use different temperatures in each case.Temperature zero means that it always goes with the most predictable word, and what you get ends up being a trite derivative of Goldilocks.A higher temperature gives it a chance to choose less likely words, but it comes with a risk.In this case, the story starts out more originally, about a young web artist from South Korea, but it quickly degenerates into nonsense.Technically speaking, the API doesn't actually let you pick a temperature bigger than 2.There's no mathematical reason for this, it's just an arbitrary constraint imposed to keep their tool from being seen generating things that are too nonsensical.So if you're curious, the way this animation is actually working is I'm taking the 20 most probable next tokens that GPT-3 generates, which seems to be the maximum they'll give me, and then I tweak the probabilities based on an exponent of 1 5th.As another bit of jargon, in the same way that you might call the components of the output of this function probabilities, people often refer to the inputs as logits, or some people say logits, some people say logits, I'm gonna say logits.So for instance, when you feed in some text, you have all these word embeddings flow through the network, and you do this final multiplication with the unembedding matrix, machine learning people would refer to the components in that raw, unnormalized output as the logits for the next word prediction.A lot of the goal with this chapter was to lay the foundations for understanding the attention mechanism, Karate Kid wax-on-wax-off style.You see, if you have a strong intuition for word embeddings, for softmax, for how dot products measure similarity, and also the underlying premise that most of the calculations have to look like matrix multiplication with matrices full of tunable parameters, then understanding the attention mechanism, this cornerstone piece in the whole modern boom in AI, should be relatively smooth.For that, come join me in the next chapter.As I'm publishing this, a draft of that next chapter is available for review by Patreon supporters.A final version should be up in public in a week or two, it usually depends on how much I end up changing based on that review.In the meantime, if you want to dive into attention, and if you want to help the channel out a little bit, it's there waiting.

Video script Hi. It’s Mr. Andersen and this AP Physics
essentials video 130. It is on kinetic theoryand temperature. Temperature is a macroscopic
value. In other words if I look to the leftI have some water with a thermometer in it.
We could say the temperature is around 25degrees celsius. As I add some warm water
to it, what is happening to the temperature?It is increasing. It is a higher value and
now it is around 35 degrees celsius. But thatis macroscopic. It is what we are measuring
in the world that we live in. But hopefullyyou know the temperature is caused by microscopic
interactions. So we have all of these moleculesthat are bouncing around. And so some have
slow velocity. Some have fast velocities.But the average kinetic energy of all of those
molecules is equal to the temperature. Themore they are moving the more their velocities
are the greater the temperature is. And sowouldn’t it be wonderful if we had an equation
that allowed us to move from the microscopicto the macroscopic world. Well, temperature
has to be on the left, kinetic energy hasto be on the right. This bar on the top means
that it is the average. So we could put inour formula for kinetic energy, 1/2 m v squared.
Now this velocity is the average velocityof the molecules. We call that the root mean
square. And then on the left side we haveto put in a constant. So that is the Boltzmann’s
constant. So three halves Boltzmann’s constanttimes temperature. This has to be measured
in kelvin is equal to one half m v squared.And so this allows us to move from the microscopic
world to the macroscopic world. Because temperatureis the average kinetic energy of all of the
molecules. And lots of times you will representthat using a distribution where we put the
speed on the bottom and then the number ofmolecules on the left. So we get a nice distribution
that looks like that. So if I were to saywhere is that average velocity? The tendency
is to want to put the average right here butit is actually going to be, since it goes
to the right, it is going to be a little bitoff center like that. So here is our formula
again. What is this? This is going to be theroot mean square, which is going to be the
average velocity of all of those molecules.And so what we can do is if we know that value,
know the temperature and Boltzmann’s constantwe can figure out the kinetic energy of even
one molecule. And so temperature, remember,is going to be molecules bouncing around.
On the left I have some cold water. On theright I have some warmer hot water. I put
some dye in it so you can see the moleculesinteracting with the dye. I have done some
time lapse here so you can see it moving around.So you can see on the right side there is
more molecular motion. More of those moleculesare moving around so we get greater distribution
of the dye. And so we use a thermometer tomeasure how fast those molecules are going.
So with the celsius scale 0 is going to befreezing. But what happens if we slow those
molecules to a stop? That is going to be absolutezero and we use the Kelvin scale to do that.
And so remember if you are ever convertinga temperature to Kelvin, which you will have
to do with any of these problems, all youdo is simply add 273 to it. So that would
be 288 Kelvin on the left, 338 Kelvin on theright. And so here is a way that we could
apply that formula in the easiest sense. Whatis the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule
at 25 degrees celsius? What is neat is thatit does not matter what that gas molecule
is. So we know kinetic energy is three-halvesk T. That is what we are asked for in this
problem. I would look up the Boltzmann’sconstant. That is going to be 1.38 times 10
to the negative 23 joules per Kelvin. Anddo not forget to convert 25 degrees celsius
to Kelvin. So that would be 298 Kelvin. Andso we could figure out the kinetic energy
of 1 gas molecule is going to be 6.2 times10 to the negative 22 joules. And see how
powerful that equation is. It allows us togo from just a temperature to this microscopic
value, the amount of kinetic energy of a singlegas molecule. So if we look at the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution we are going to have a bunchof gas moving around. They are each going
to have different velocities. Some high somelow. So we get a distribution that looks like
that. The largest value, most probable velocity,but to the right side of that we are going
to have what is called the root mean squarevelocity. That is going to be the average
velocity of all the molecules that are movingaround. So here is the root mean square. So
how do we calculate that? Well here is thatformula again. If I want to solve for the
velocity, so if I want to solve for just thisvalue right here, my root mean square is equal
to the root of 3 k T divided by m. m is goingto be the mass of the molecule itself. And
so this could be a quantitative problem thatyou would solve. Find the root mean square
of a nitrogen molecule at 0 degrees celsius.So how would you solve this problem? Well
we know the Boltzmann’s constant, we knowthe temperature, since it is at 0 degrees
celsius. We then have to find the mass ofa nitrogen molecule. So you would have to
use a little bit of chemistry. And so we coulduse the periodic table to figure out the mass
of a nitrogen molecule is equal to 4.65 times10 to the negative 26. We plug all of those
values in here and then we would find theroot mean square of nitrogen. But in AP Physics
they do not want you to solve in quantitatively.They want you to be able to read a distribution
like this. So let me pose the same question.What is the root mean square of a nitrogen
molecule at 0 degrees celsius? So readingthis graph I see that nitrogen is going to
be the red. You can see that nice distributionlike this. We are reading velocities on the
bottom. And so if I were to approximate offto the right here, I would say it is going
to be a little over 500 meters per second.And so you can read the distribution to figure
it out. And so did you learn to qualitativelyconnect the microscopic to macroscopic world?
I hope so. And I hope that was helpful.

Video script I'm John Filson. I'm a peace studies
instructor at Chapman University.So what is peace studies?It's not this:It's more like this:Ibrahim lives in the Central African
Republic.He grew up with friends of all different ethnicities and religions.But there's a history of conflict between Christians and Muslimsfueled by fears of exclusion and poverty.In 2013, an armed uprising overthrew the government, sparking violence all over the country.Ibrahim watched as his friends were
forced to choose sides amid the growing danger.Despite the risks, Ibrahim and
local religious leaders made contactwith militias to try to address their
grievances without attacking civilians.Today he continues this crucial
diplomacy to prevent his community from spiralinginto an all-out war.The purpose of peace studies is to understand the complicated reasons people resort to violenceand to figure out strategies that help peace-builders like Ibrahim succeed.How and why do people become divided and ultimately violent toward each other?What strategies are effective in real life to
both prevent violencebut also change some of the social and political factorsthat draw people into conflict in the first place?I don't think we all like violence. At
least personally I don't.And especially nowadays we feel like there's just a lot tension in the political arenaand I feel like it's a good tool to learn
how to listen to each otherand really try to create change.There is peace studies, and there is peace-building.Peace studies is a school
subject like physics or literature.It's interdisciplinary, which means it draws
ideas from many different subjectslike political science, economics, history,
and sociology.There are many lenses that are used through peace studies.Instead of just: "How can we efficiently solve this problem?"It's: "How can we make sure that
all people get the best solution possiblein the most peaceful way?"Peace-building is a professional field, like law or journalism.It's the actual work on the ground of implementing strategiesto both prevent violence and change the root causes of violence.It can happen at the interpersonal level, the societal level,or even the global level between countries.Many people who work toward peace-building call it other things.Development, for example, aims to tackle poverty.Humanitarian aid helps
people in emergency situations.Human Rights and the rule of law helps hold perpetrators of crimes accountable.There's diplomacy and mediation to
defuse tense situations that might turn violent,And then of course there's the
long-term conflict resolution workthat aims to transform the relationship
between different groups of people.Peace isn't something that needs to be
particularly attained just by foreign countries.It's something that can happen on smaller levels, even just with between two people.And I feel like all of the tools
we learn to effectively communicateand effectively listen can also
can just pertain to everyday life.Our field is built on certain values.For example,increasing peace anywhere, in any form, starts with self-awareness.I'm white, I'm a man, I'm straight, I'm able-bodied,I'm middle-class by United States standards, and I'm filthy rich by global standards.Who am I to go into someone
else's life and someone else's conflictand say: "You know what? I have answers for you."And yet, I do have something to offer.I have certain skills and talents,
experiences, insights,all that can be helpful to people who are struggling through conflict situations.Peace studies is also very data-driven.We're not interested in assumptions or wishful thinking.We want facts, we want hard data, we want to know that things we're talking aboutcan actually be effective in real life.So that's why there's a good balance in our field between theory and practice.You need both the study of peace and the practice of peace-buildingto inform a knowledge base that everyone can use.If you've watched the video this far, then some part of you believes thatthe world doesn't have to be quite as violent or unfair as it is sometimes.Peace-builders very much believe that.We're not naive to think that we have
all the solutions, or that we can eradicate violence.But we're also not naive to think that some change and improvement is impossible.It is possible.More and more people are understanding the value of studying conflict and violenceand what really creates peace and what doesn't.There's plenty of people who believe that humans can do better, and we're working toward that.That's what we're about.Peace studies is important because we live in such a competitive society.A lot of times groups can be marginalized or the needs of groups can be forgotten.And peace studies focuses in on those groups.So it works for more people rather than for less people.I love this field because I admire people like Ibrahim.Danger, threats to himself and his loved
ones descended upon his community.But he didn't walk the other way. In fact,Every day he gets up and he chooses not to walk the other direction.At great personal cost.But he does it because he knows it's good.And I think that's the best of what human beings are. And that's what I want to be.If that resonates with you, you should explore peace studies.Thank you for watching.

Video script Michael: This is PACS 164A, 
Theory and Practice of Nonviolence.So, if any of you were here for Chem 8 
or something like that, this is your chance to slip out.Okay? You’ve lost your chance.Years ago, I was starting this course onceand I said something which caused a couple 
of people to get very offended and stalk out.So, as you know, we have a long wait list for this class, 
so I’m going to say it again.And what I wanted to say is that given
what’s going on in the world today,this might very well be the most important subject
that we could possibly be studying.And there I said it, and I’m glad.We do have a full class and a wait list
so what I’m going to do is pass around the attendance sheetswhile we’re going and just check off next to your name.Hand this around.And I’ll try to figure something out by the second week
as to getting people in the class.As you probably are aware by now 
the course is being webcast.That should not impact your life terribly much.What it will mean is – well, if you didn’t want your parents to
know you were in Berkeley, it might be a bit of a problem.But all it will mean really is that I’m dressed up a little bit 
nicer that I usually am – as in my unself-conscious way.And if I remember I will repeat back the questions 
that you ask me, which is not a bad thing.You know, within the area known of nonviolence 
communication there’s a practice known as“Compassionate Listening” and that’s how it works.Somebody says, “Oh, I think you’re a blah-blah.”And you say, “I see you think I’m a blah-blah.Very good.”And go on from there.So we’ll actually be being nonviolent.And while we’re on that subject, this has been a very good
opening semester for me.I’ve already – I mean the semester is only six hours old – for me –and I’ve already had an opportunity to
practice satyagraha on a minor levelwhich I’ll be telling you about it a little while.What I’d like to do this year – 
and we are going to get into the nuts and boltsand who’s in the class and who isn’t
and what the scheduled reading list is likeand so forth and all of the usual announcements.But I think I’d like to start off 
with a couple of very simple storiesthat will kind of give us a framework for what we’re looking
at when we go to study nonviolence as I understand it.One technical thing I’ll do before we start that, 
I have some copies of the syllabus here.I don’t have enough for everybody because;
A, the copy machine isn’t working in my department.And B, it would be ecologically incorrect to make 
80 copies of thiswhen most of you have known for years
that you want to study nonviolence more than anything.And you’re in it for the semester and want to be here.And the syllabus is in the Reader.The Reader, incidentally will say on it, “PACS 164B.”A, B, very difficult to work that out.But it’s actually PACS 164A, okay?So if for some reason you really
want to have a syllabus todayand maybe a day or so before you get 
around to getting a reader, take one of these, okay?Pass that around.So I wanted to tell you two stories.The first one involves a region, not exactly a nation state, 
and there are regions that are not exactly nation states.This is not the 18th century anymore.And this little region is called, “Ladakh.”It’s a Himalayan region.And geographically it kind of borders Tibet and India.So parts of it are considered to be politically part of India, 
parts are considered to be politically part of Tibet.And it got a lot of attention recently – well, about ten years 
ago because there was a woman who went to Ladakhand discovered that they have some very,
very interesting patterns of life, in a way.I mean she didn’t use the term because nobody uses the 
term nonviolence if they can help it,but in a way they had a very nonviolent culture
with some very interesting attributeswhich were startling for a Westerner.Now I should say that Ladakh
was not a subsistence economy.They were a little bit above subsistence.They had very beautiful art, artifacts, it’s a Buddhist countryso that’s probably the reason that Helena Norberg-Hodge 
went there to study them.So, these people aren’t starving but they’re living
up in the higher slopes of the Himalayasand it’s not exactly like Cabo San Lucas there.And food is an important item.She discovered that, for example, if one family
has had a bag of rice stolen –this happened while she was there, and this is serious.This is a major part of their – it’s a staple.And so, she expected these people to make some 
moves to get their rice back –and they didn’t.So, she went to them and said, “Well, I guess you have no
way of knowing who stole the rice.”And they said, “Of course we know who stole the rice.It’s a small village.We know everything that goes on.”So, she said, “Well, what are you going to do about it?”And they said, “What?Do something about it?We don’t do things about stuff here.”And she probed a little further and began to realize that,
to these people, community is of paramount importance.And if you take off after somebody and say,
“Hey, you know, you stole my bag of rice,”yeah, you’d get some rice back, but you’d lose the relationship.When you’re living in a small group like that, the relationship
in the long run is more important than the rice.So our concept of justice is not operating here.And people began to realize that this is really – 
once you got over the shock of these little differences,Ladakh was a very happy place.It took a while to realize that because it was not a rich place.You didn’t see a Mercedes because they wouldn’t get 
around very well up there.But it was a happy little world, really.I mean I don’t want to be too corny about it, 
but it was happy.People had good relationships,
they had a religion that they took seriously,actually involved a certain amount of spiritual practice.Everybody had enough to eat.I think they were probably happier there than the folks 
that I visited this summer in Nicaragua.But then because of the interest taken in Ladakh by 
outsiders – officially Westerners –there’s this idea, “Oh, they’re such good people.We must help them ‘develop.’”
So by now we know that this is a bad idea,but in the 70s and 80s we thought it was wonderful idea.So they got in and they tried to “develop” Ladakh 
because all they had was happiness at this point.And it’s hard to motivate them to do the things that would 
lead to Western-style development.And one person actually said, “If we’re going to develop this
place, we’re going to have to teach them to be greedy.”Sound like a good idea?So they taught them to be greedy
and basically the place is a mess.All the things that they had going for them are breaking down.I’m talking, of course, in broad overgeneralizations.That’s what we need to do right now to
sort of get us started.So relationships are very bad, crime is high,
young people don’t have any purpose to live for,they don’t have seminars on the meaning
of life so they’re kind of at a loss.And all of the parameters of failure of a modern society are now coming up very fast in Ladakh.Health stuff, poverty stuff, alienation of every kind.So what happened here?Well, although I am a professor and my job description 
states that I am supposed to take simple ideasand make them complex enough so that 
intellectuals can understand them.That’s what professors do.Every now and then I step out of my role and I ask myself,“Is there a simple model by which we can
understand what went wrong here?”Let me read you a quote from the New Internationalist.Is this from the New Internationalist?
No.It’s from Amnesty International.
the first example in false attribution.See what happens when I step out of my professorial role?There’s a singer in Kingston, Jamaica.Her name is Queen Ifrica and she told AI Magazine, 
“If you’re developing a positive energy,no matter where your house is, you can bring that to the
community and to your surroundings.And from there we can see if we can bring about a different
kind of change instead of taking up a gun.”This is written in a very impoverished 
community, incidentally.So she gives this idea of positive energy.And here’s what I’m going to do by the way
of explaining what happened in Ladakh.And again, I apologize for the simplicity of this model.It’s very insulting for an upper division course at Berkeley, 
but don’t worry, it’s going to complexify from here on out.But I would say you had basically a positive situation 
and introduced negative energy and the thing tanked.It’s that simple.Life isn’t that simple, but the model
that we’re using to understand it is that simple.Okay?So, let’s take now a contrasting story.This story takes place in Bihar.About four or five years ago there was 
an outbreak of communal rioting –that is rioting between Muslims and Hindus.In this case, when you read about it in the news – 
if you still read the news –one of my hopes for this course
is that you’ll stop doing that unhealthy habit.Anyway, if you read about it in the commercial mass media
you read that this was, you know, neighbors who had – seething with violence for a long time.They had risen up against one another and it’s terrible.But I heard a talk from a woman who works 
with a peace organization –a nonviolence organization in the north of India.She’s from Gujarat which is Gandhi’s home state.Her name was Nirmala Deshpande and she 
came from this areawhere they had rushed to see what they could do 
and she told us two things.“First of all, do not believe what
you’re reading in the papers.”I said, “Hey, no problem.I haven’t done that since I was 18.”“Secondly,” she said, “Let me tell you
what actually went on in those villageswhich you will never hear in the mass media.First of all, this was not neighbors.These were mobs who were instigated 
to do this by the central government.The GOI, Government of India these days
has been in the control of the party,which is a very secular, sectarian, pro-troublemaking.”I know it sounds like I’m describing another country.But no, this is true in India also.And they actually instigated these mobs 
and furnished them with these high-pressured gas canistersand stuff to do this mayhem.So, these are basically “Hindu” mobs.They come sweeping into these little agricultural villages and
because they’re agricultural villages most of the men areout in the fields when these ruffians arrive and so it’s just 
the women and some of the Muslim menbecause Muslims tend to be artisans rather than farmers.And immediately, without any preparation,
without discussing it ahead of time –they had no idea this was going to happen.Immediately, they took their Muslim neighbors
into their home to hide them, okay?Well, hide is a euphemism because most 
of these houses are a single room.So the Muslim man comes into the house and the woman of 
the house shoos him under the Puta table, under the alter.So immediately you have this wonderful situation where you
have the statue of Ganesha – I don't know,Krishna or something like that and these
Muslims are cowering underneath it.Okay, now here’s where we get
to the point of our story for our purposes.Home after home, the same procedure was repeated.The mob would come up to the door, the woman would be
standing there in the doorwayand they mob would say,
“We think you’re hiding a Muslim in there.”And immediately the woman of the house would say, 
“Yes, I am.”And it’s a big moment of shock.And they would say, “Well, we want him out of there.”And the woman would say,
“First kill me, then you may enter.”And the mob would turn around and go.So they saved hundreds and hundreds of lives by doing this.And again, this is people who, you know, if you stopped on
the street corner and said, “What is nonviolence?How do you it?”They probably would not have been 
able to articulate anything.But I’m going to say, in my simple-minded mode here, 
that you had a very negative situation – very negative.I’m saying it’s Bihar, it might have been Gujarat, 
but that’s not material for us.And these women introduced positive energy into a negative
situation and the thing was drastically improved.So, it was improved in so many ways.I mean you can just imagine what the relationship was like in
those villages between the Hindus and Muslims now,now that these Hindu wives 
had risked their lives to save those men.You can imagine the beneficial impact
that it had on those mobs who were being told,you know, these people are going to welcome you as liberators – oh, I’m sorry.That’s the wrong conflict.I got confused there for a minute.I was going to these Hindus are going to welcome you in.They’ve been meaning to get rid of their Muslim neighbors
and they go in there believing that violence is invincible.They have much more power than the women have.The women are unarmed.They have all these gas canisters.They’re enraged.So they go in there fully expecting to commit murder 
and get away with it.They have this complete shock of the type of resistance that
they did not expect and they go away, thinking.So for everyone in the situation – everyone in the situation – 
obviously, the Muslim men who got saved, but everyone involved. but everyone involved.The women have a new sense of their own power,the mobs who have a different sense of what violence can 
and cannot achieve, a situation,a communal rioting in general, because these things,
as we know, have a tendency to spread.Bad things spread become worse.Good things spread, become better.So for everyone there’s a huge improvement
in the situation.And you look at this model and you look at the world around 
you and you’re tempted to say to the world,“What part of this don’t you understand?”It’s so incredibly simple.If you introduce positive energy into a situation, duh,
it gets better.If you introduce negative energy, it gets worse.It’s that simple.Don’t tell your parents this is what you learned in 
PACS 164A because it’s not sophisticated enough,but we’re going to fix that in a little while.But really, it’s that simple and how people cannot get it – 
it’s frustrating and amazing.But if you take that question seriously, 
what part of this don’t you understand?It does have a serious answer.And that is people, generally speaking, 
do not understand that there is such a thing as positive energyand there is a such a thing as negative energy.As a result of that failure, they keep on trying to fix problems
with negative energy, thus making them worse.That’s happening in every sector of our society today.This brings me to my little satyagraha this morning.I’m very proud of this.I was in a building where I work and I was talking
to one of the staff people who works there.She said, “By the way, you’ve got a new arrangement here.In order for you get out the backdoor or to access the 
bathrooms before 8 o'clock in the morning.”I said, “Yeah, I get in at 7:30.Sometimes I have a cup of tea before I leave the house.It’s handy for me to get into the bathroom before 8 o'clock.She said, “Okay, well, these doors 
are now armed with this deviceand you have to plug in a number to get either out to the 
back – to the back bathroom or the front bathroom.”But she’s being very unhappy when she’s telling me this and
I’m not being very happy listening to her –and something else is going on.She’s handing me this number on a little Post-it.She said, “Don’t let anyone ever see this because every time
you use this number it shows up on my computer.”I said, “Wait a minute.I go to the bathroom in the morning
and it shows up on your computer?”She said, “Yes, this is a security issue.”I said, “Thanks, but no thanks.”And I handed back the little Post-it.So I’m going to be very uncomfortable sometimes when I 
show up for the meditation class in the morning.But, you see, for me, the cost is greater than the benefit.And I speak as one who did have his
backpack stolen out of his little cubby.And fortunately, I didn’t have, you know, 
my laptop or my ego in it.Sometimes I leave my ego in there [Laughter] taking that problem.So, I know full well that there is a 
security problem in our building.And it’s not that I have transcended
fear or concerns of that kind.In fact, to tell you a little story on myself – 
because I’ll be telling you many stories later in which I play a rather heroic role.So, to balance that, I’ll tell you this story.I went in one morning, as usual, 7:30, you know, 
looking around for the door the bathroom.I pulled out my mail and there was a notice saying that from
now on there’s a new security arrangement.I said, “Oh God, now what?”It said, “Don’t trust anybody.Anyone is to be regarded as suspicious if they are,
for example, a student or things like this.”I’m slightly exaggerating.If there’s an object that you don’t recognize, report it 
immediately to Homeland Security and things like that.I said, “You know, the hell with this.I’m not going to do that.This is not how I live.”And I crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it away.And then I went to my cubby and I walked in
and there was a black satchel in the middle of the floor.And immediately, before I knew I was doing I said,
“Call the police! Homeland Security, 911,get the bomb squad in here!” [Laughter]Of course, it was a laptop that the tech people had left in 
there while they were fixing my computer.So what am I saying?I’m not saying I’m an unusual person
with regard to courage or anything else.But, for me, I always hear ringing in my ears what the 
Buddha said, “That there is no fire like desire,there is no rage like anger,
there is no relationship better than trust.”And if you go around degrading the trust in human 
relationships you’re paying a pricewhich is higher than the price of losing your backpack,
losing your laptop occasionally.Sort of an honorary Ladakhi in this regard.So, the point I’m making that because we never 
think in these terms, is this positive or negativeand its impact on human relationships, we solve every 
problem, but with negative energy –and that puts the word “solve” in quotes
and it never gets any better.In fact, it gets consistently worse.So, we’re going to fix all of that in this semester
which is why I told you this could be an important course.And basically, if you wanted to define what we’re studying, 
we’re studying the nature of positive energy,how to develop it, and how to implement
it in the social field, okay?You might almost take that as 
my definition of nonviolence for right now.I’m famous for my definitions of nonviolence – 
they have about a 14 day half-life.I’ll be bringing in some other ones, but for now,
this is what we’ll be looking at.How did those women do what they did?How did it affect them?How did it work in this situation? And finally, how could we capture that energy and make institutions out of it so that our whole world works onpositive energy instead of working on about 10% positive energy and 90% negative energy? Okay?So that’s the agenda and I guess I’ll pause for a minute and 
see if you have any questions about what nonviolence isor about these stories, the point I was trying 
to make with them,and then we can talk about how the course is going to work.We’re going to get the books and good stuff like that.Do you have any questions?
Okay.That’s either a very good or a very bad sign.We’ll find out in a little while.So you are going to get the reader from Copy Central
and that will have the syllabus,which some of you have hard copies of already.And basically the course unrolls in sections.The first is kind of a background in general principles
and then we start with, really,the major part of the content which is the story of Gandhi’s
career which itself divides neatly into two phases – the South Africa part from 1893 to 1914,and then the big freedom struggle in India from 1915 until 
1947 followed by his assassination.And then that’ll take us down to the midterm.And then we’re going to look at the West because we’ve 
been drawing upon Hinduism and Gandhi’simplementation of it and how it made, in some ways, 
made it possible for him to do all of thisthat I’ve been describing in a big institutional framework.And we’re going to look at nonviolence in the West.We’re going to look at Christianity – where there’s some
really interesting scholarly developments in the last10 or 15 years, basically which make 
it much more plausible.What Gandhi used to say – he used to say,“The only people who do understand that Jesus was
nonviolent are the Christians.”We’re going to sort of study how that came about.And then we’ll spend about a month with Martin Luther Kingand then we’ll do sort of an overview where
we’ll look at what have we inherited from these people.How is it to be employed in economics, 
and conflict management, health care?All of those things.And that’s 164A.And 164B, as some of you know very well, kind of looks back
at the World War II period to get kind of an historicalbackground and it quickly moves up to see what’s been 
happening in nonviolence for the last 20 or 30 years,which is incredibly inspiring and exciting.In fact, I’ll skip ahead a little bit now and mention that I’d 
like you people to be aware, not involved, but aware –because I don’t want you in prison during the course of this
semester – that on September 21st,which is International Peace Day there’s a rather 
large civil disobedience that’s been organized –primarily in the U.S. but with worldwide support – 
along very good Gandhian lines.We’re going to– they, sorry I said that.[Laughter] They’re going to tell the government sometime 
earlyin September that we want to see a plan for a complete exit
from Iraq by September 21st, not just the military pullout,but you know, give the country back all of its assets 
otherwise you’ll have to face massive satyagraha from us.So that’s the plan.So watch that.It’ll be a very interesting laboratory for us.So yeah? Question?Student: What kind of civil disobedience?Michael: That’s being worked out right now.I think the first audience to whom we were going to – sorry –they are going to offer satyagraha is lawmakers, 
you know, Congress people.But they’re also working a lot with ex-military people, 
you know, Veterans Against War, stuff like that.Student: If you have an older copy of the Reader
a few years ago, will that –Michael: Yeah, you’ll be fine with that.Buddy up with somebody who’s just taking the course 
now because there will be a few new items.But basically you’ll be fine.Student: If you could repeat the question?Michael: I’m sorry, Yes. I’ll repeat the questions.That one was just about what kind of reader device,
so that’s all right.Other questions? Okay.So now in the readings, first let's deal with the basic 
historical information about Gandhi.You’re going to have a wonderful book called, 
“Gandhi, the Man,”which has quotes and photos and he’s very much a kind of
inspirational piece that gives you, I think,the deepest sense of who Gandhi was spiritually without
which you can’t understand anything else in his careerand his impact. But it doesn’t step you
through the history in a historical way.And I think it’s necessary for us to do that.So over the years I discovered there’s an excellent biography
of Gandhi by an Indian scholar named B.R. NandaBal Ram K. Nanda – and it existed in the abridged 
edition that’s perfect for this course.So you have the best biography of the most important figure
in modern times, what do you think happened?You guessed it.It went out of print.So I can’t get the abridged edition.So for a couple of years I was using the full edition which
costs a little more, but it’s good to have it.And I gave people the chapters 
that they would have to read.Then that went out of print, 
which I discovered a couple of weeks ago.So we have two options.We can fall back on rather good biography by Louie Fisher
which I’ve ordered and which you have in the bookstore.And would you just read along the necessary chapters for 
the necessary parts of the history that we’re doing.– early South Africa, climax in South Africa,
return to India and so forth.But I actually think that the Nanda book is better.Nanda was actually an Indian after all 
and he was involved in the freedom struggle.And so he had a better sense of how 
certain things were working.And what we’ve done is we’ve gone and xeroxed that book, 
the abridged edition,and it is available at Copy Central – in the reader.It costs $17 - $16,9006, but who’s counting?And I personally don’t care which way you want to go.You can get either one of those biographies, okay?There’s one book which I’m
not giving you regular assignments from,but I’d like for you to just be reading at your own pace 
and basically finish it in the course of the semester.That’s my book. Blush.[Laughter] It’s, “The Search for a Nonviolent Future.”Basically, that book came out of this course so it will be a 
very good way for you to follow along with the course.The reader, I don’t use the reader the way some instructors
do, that is I don’t come in and say,“Now let’s look at Section 2B and let’s talk about it.”I will do that intermittently, but mostly I’m leaving it up to 
you to follow the third column of the syllabusand just keep up with the readings, okay?So they’re sort of backgrounders.Every now and then – because this conversation in this 
course will shape itself in one way or another.All of a sudden we see, “Oh, I see where we’re going.We need to have a look at this particular article.I’ll come and I’ll say I hope you have your Readers today,”which is unfair because I have no idea until a few hours ago 
that I was going to look at this particular article.So if you don’t, that’s okay also.So I hope that’s alright because sometimes people expectthat we’re going to step through the Reader systematically 
in a course and I don’t usually do that.About the webcasting thing let me say one thing.The reason we’re webcasting the course is there’s a rumor
circulating around that I am not immortal –because I choose not to believe it, but some people do – 
and therefore people really wanted to have a record of thiscourse for people who, you know, terribly unfortunate 
people, perhaps, couldn’t even come to Berkeley.Maybe they’re studying at Stanford or something.[Laughter]You know, there’s all kinds of unfairness
and deprivation in our world.We wanted to have this for a record.The reason I’m mentioning it is,
please don’t use it a reason not to come to class, okay?Don’t say, “Oh, you know, I want to hang out with my friend.It’s on the Web anyway,” because it’s very different when 
you’re actually here and I’m actually here.We’re interacting.It’s a different experience qualitatively than, 
you know, opening up your laptop anddownloading that particular lecture.If you don’t believe that, you’re really going to have a hard 
time understanding nonviolence.Okay, now this course has an unofficial “lab.”It’s called PACS 84.It’s a meditation class.Yeah, question?Student: I think it’s actually PACS 94.Michael: You’re right, thanks.By the way, this is a very good thing to do.Whenever I’m using a number, chances
are I’m getting it wrong.So do stick your hand up.Yeah, it’s PACS 94.84 is the software center.It’s a meditation class.It’s never overcrowded for one – well, for two reasons
because meditation is not all that popular.And B, this class meets at 8:00 AM.So it’s Tuesday – there we go right there.I just lost two-thirds of our audience.But if you can get there and develop a 
meditation practice, in some subtle ways,which I would find it a little bit hard to define.You will find it a lot easier to grok some of the basic ideas
about how nonviolence works.I actually – because, you know, I’m a troublemaker,
satyagrahi from way back.I actually wanted to get that course called 164L for lab.Then maybe I can get a National Institute of Science grant 
or something like thatand solve the whole department’s problem, be a hero.I’d dream on and on.But the Committee on Courses wouldn’t let me do that.As some of you know they said in order for a course to have 
a L afterwards it has to be a wet lab.That is you have to actually deal with chemicals 
and come in and show that.Sulfuric acid, see?I said, “Kundalini won’t be enough?”But no, apparently it was not.I’m mentioning that because the course is open, 
still has a few seats and a few people want to take it,you know, like if you have insomnia and you’re wondering
what to do at 8:00 AM, come around to 101 Wheeler,you will find it helpful.You don’t have to sign up if you want the unit of credit, 
you know, this and – you can do that.The nature of this class then of you people 
is such that very soon,every time I come in here six or seven of you are going to 
rush up to the desk and say, “Can I make an announcement?We’re about to stop a whaling ship or a hug a tree or lock 
ourselves together in some office in downtown Oaklandand we need some help.”So for a couple of reasons I made it a policy not to take up
class time with those announcements.One of those reasons is that occasionally 
we have had some military people in this class.In fact, I like to have them here.And at some point in the semester I may actually trade lectures with the head of Air Force Military Affairs here on campus.I got to meet the original guy who 
was in that position because he was on my van,you know, we were commuting together.He made the mistake one day – 
we were hanging around waiting for the van.He said, “So what do you teach?”I could have a number of different things, 
but of course I brightened up and I said, “Nonviolence.”And to his credit he immediately said, 
“I want to come talk to your class.”So he did.He came and talked to the class and then afterwards in good – like in red-blooded competitive style, I said, 
“Randy, how about a rematch?How about I come talk to your class?”He hadn’t counted on that.And it was really a fascinating experience for meand I am in favor of reaching out and getting 
beyond our community and talking to people.So that person may be here.For all I know some of you are in Military Affairs Program.And I don’t want people who don’t share
our viewpoint to feel uncomfortable.So partly for that reason and partly
because it can really eat up all of our class time.What I usually do is I have just people
who drop announcements hereor maybe use the board over there – unless it’s an event 
that I really like or that I’m involved in.So let’s see, I just have a couple of things to go over and 
then I think I can stop and see if you have any questionsand see how much time we have,
and maybe get into a little bit more into the subject.There will be a lot of opportunities for various kinds of
volunteer work that come out of this class.So if you have some time and you like to get involved in 
stuff, just let me know.We have a relationship with Berkeley High School.They want to do some peace education 
there so if you’d like to really, you know,intercept some persons wasted career 
and put them on a right path, let me know.We’re going to be developing how we’re to do that.Okay, and then I think the only other thing I have to tell you is – 
well, let me ask you, what’s going to happen on 9/11?Why is 9/11 an important day?It’s partly a trick question.Student: It’s the 100th Anniversary of satyagraha.Michael: That’s right.Very good.How did I know you would know that?On September 11th it will be the 
100th Anniversary of the birth of satyagraha.Properly speaking, nonviolent resistance 
which happened at a big meeting in Johannesburg,South Africa in 1906 on September 11th.Empire Theatre.Student: Can you write the word down?Michael: We’re going to be into these words up to here.But that’s okay, in fact, it’s a good idea 
because who knows who will come in here after this class.We’ll put it newspaper headline style, “Satyagraha born.September 11, 1906.Empire Theater, Johan- they called it Jo’ burg over there.Johannesburg, South Africa.”The theatre burned down the next morning 
which the Hindus thought was a very good sign.And in fact, eight years later they had achieved their goals.So this is – yes, it’s the 5th Anniversary of that horrible stuff,
but it’s also the 100th Anniversary,the centenary of the birth of satyagraha.And people all over the world are 
using the 9/11 hook or they call –I forget the technical term the media people use for this – 
to raise consciousness about nonviolence.And to do my own little part, I wrote this little book called, 
“Hope or Terror,” which is very attractive.And for reasons that some of you know –
and is basically flying out the door.We have only a few copies left.And what we’re doing is we’re using it as a premium if 
people want to give donations to my non-profit.So, I’m going to make these available to you.I have an envelope here.Basically, if you want to give us – 
give that non-profit of mine $5,you can take a copy of the book.
I have more of them in my office.And what this book does, as someone told me recently, 
it basically crash-courses satyagraha.I’m not saying that this will be 
a tremendously helpful text for you for this course.If it were, I would require it.We’d all be rich by now.But it could be a help because
it will you give you in 40 pages, right?In 40 pages it will give you an overview of how satyagraha 
works, what makes it have its effect,how to do it, what to watch out for.And you know, for a half or our so read,
it’ll kind of orient you and get you started in this.It will also be handy, I think, in case you have a roommate.Because what always happens in this course is they both 
come to their living arrangementand they start talking very 
enthusiastically about nonviolenceand then these questions come up which I know all too well.And people want to be able to say, “Here, look, read this.By the way, it’s five bucks.”So I’m just leaving it here.Go ahead and take on and put in some money in the 
envelope if you’d be so kind.If you don’t have $5 on you – 
meaning that you’re a Berkeley student,don’t give me a check but bring in the cash next time.It’s okay.It’s on the honor system, as you know  that’s how I operate.Well, okay, I think I’ve gotten
through all my announcements.So is there anything technical – 
oh, there’s one thing I didn’t mention.Yeah. How are you going to get a grade?What’s it going to be based on?Well, the “Work” for the course is a midterm.

पढ़नेवाले हैं वो है उत्सर्जन तंत्र यानीएक्सक्रीट सिस्टम ठीक है सो आइए स्टार्टकरते हैं किसकी बात करने वाले हैं बेटा जीउत्सर्जन तंत्र की बात करने वाले हैंएक्सक्रीट सिस्टम की हम बात करने वाले हैंयहां पर ठीक है देखिए इस एनिमेशन को देखकरआपको कुछ समझ में तो आ ही गया होगा आपनेपढ़ा भी हुआ है उत्सर्जन तंत्र के अंतर्गतहमारा हमारी अगर हम बात करें हमाराउत्सर्जी अंग कौन से होते हैं सो ये होतीहै ये मुख्य रूप से ये कौन किडनी जिसको हमवृत बोलते हैं इनसे नलिका निकलती हैं जिसेमूत्र नलिका बोलते हैं ठीक है मूत्र नलिकादेखो ये दो किडनी है दोनों किडनी से मूत्रनलिका निकलती है ये मूत्र नलिका नीचे आकरखुलती है किसमें मूत्राशय में एक ऐसीसंरचना जिसके अंदर मूत्र इकट्ठा होता हैफिर इससे नीचे निकलता है क्या मूत्र मार्गठीक है सो मुख्य रूप से यहां पर हमारा जोउत्सर्जी अंग जो है वो कौन है किडनी हैक्योंकि इसी में किसका फॉर्मेशन होता हैमूत्र का यूरीन का जो एक उत्सर्जी उत्पादहै ठीक है चलिए सर इतनी सी बात समझ में आगई अब हमारी एनसीआरटी स्टार्ट कैसे करतीहै देखिए हमारी एनसीआरटी बोलती है भाई किहर जीव जो है खाना खाता है हां खाता हैबिल्कुल खाता है भोजन बिना भोजन के तोजिंदा नहीं रह सकता है ना खाता है अब वोजब भोजन का उपभोग करता है तो कुछ अपशिष्टपदार्थ बनते हैं क्या बोला मैंने ध्यान सेसुन ध्यान से सुन मैंने भोजन खाया भोजनखाने से मेरे अंदर कुछ ऐसे उत्पाद बने जोमेरे लिए टॉक्सिक है विषैले हैं अपशिष्टकहलाते हैं तो ऐसे अपशिष्ट पदार्थों कोनिकालना पड़ेगा त्यागना पड़ेगा है ना औरउनको त्यागने से संबंधित जो तंत्र होता हैउसे हम क्या बोलेंगे उत्सर्जन तंत्र बताइएये बिल्कुल बालकों वाली छोटे बालकों वालीलैंग्वेज में चीज समझ में आई कि नहीं आईबहुत ही छोटे बालक की तरह मैंने आपकोसमझाया क्या कि व्हाट इज उत्सर्जन तंत्रव्हाट इज एक्सक्रीट सिस्टम तो हम बोलेंगेएक ऐसा सिस्टम एक ऐसा तंत्र जिसके अंतर्गतहम क्या करने वाले हैं शरीर में जोहानिकारक पदार्थ बनेंगे अपशिष्ट पदार्थबनेंगे वेस्ट फुल मटेरियल बनेंगे टॉक्सिकमटेरियल बनेंगे उन सबको शरीर से निकालनाप्रक्रिया क्या कहलाए कीी उत्सर्जन उससेसंबंधित जितने भी संरचनाएं आएंगी वो मिलकरक्या बनाएंगी उत्सर्जन तंत्र ओके सर ये तोमीनिंग समझ में आ गया व्ट इज उत्सर्जन व्टइज उत्सर्जन तंत्र ओके अब ये बताइए निकलताक्या है अपशिष्ट पदार्थ क्या है जो निकलनेवाला है तो देखिए तीन मुख्य अपशिष्टपदार्थ होते हैं कौन-कौन से एक होता हैबेटा जीअमोनिया एक कौन होता है अमोनियम एक होताहै बच्चों यहां पर याद रखना यूरिया कौनहोता हैयूरिया और एक है यूरिक अम्ल कौन है बेटायूरिक अम्ल तो मैंने आपसे सिंपल सी तीनबिंदु बोले कि मुख्य रूप से तीन अपशिष्टपदार्थ होते हैं क्या सिर्फ तीन ही होतेहैं उसके अलावा नहीं होते और भी होते हैंमेन कौन है तीन है तो सबसे पहला कौन सा थाबेटा अमोनिया जो सबसे ज्यादा क्या होता हैविषैला होता है जैसे अब मैं इसको यहां परअगर लिखूं तो ध्यान से देखना देखिए एक हैअमोनिया एक हैयूरिया और एक है यूरिक अम्ल यानी यूरिकएसिड अब ये ना कहना सर हिंदी में अमोनियायूरिया यूरिक एसिड हिंदी में भी यहीबोलेंगे अमोनिया को अमोनिया यूरिया कोयूरिया यूरिक एसिड को यूरिक अम्ल ओके सरअब बात आ रही है इनमें से सबसे खतरनाक कौनसा होता है सबसे विषैला कौन सा होता है तोहम सीधी सी बात बोलेंगे क्या सबसे विषैलाकौन होता है अमोनिया उससे थोड़ा सा कम कौनयूरिया और सबसे कम कौन यूरिक अम्ल तो सबसेकम विषैला कौन यूरिक अम्ल सबसे ज्यादाविषैला कौन अमोनिया विषैला कैसे निर्धारितकिया कि जो शरीर की क्रिया विधि को खराबकरेगा ध्यान से सुनना हमने हमने कैसे तयकिया कि भैया ये ज्यादा विषैला है अगरमेरे अंदर अमोनिया डाल दो मेरे अंदर यूरिकअम्ल डाल दो तो अमोनिया मुझे ज्यादानुकसान पहुंचा रहा है समझ रहे हैं मेरीमेरी जो किडनी है उसको ज्यादा नुकसानपहुंचा रहा है तो ज्यादा टॉक्सिक कौन हुआज्यादा विषैला कौन हुआ ये तो साहब तीनप्रकार के मुख्य रूप से अपशिष्ट पदार्थहोते हैं ऐसे अपशिष्ट पदार्थ जिनके अंदरक्या मिल रही है नाइट्रोजन तो इनको हमक्या बोलते हैं नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट पदार्थक्या मिलती है इनके अंदर नाइट्रोजन मिलतीहै इसलिए हम क्या बोलते हैं नाइट्रोजनअपशिष्ट पदार्थ डन अब देखिए ये जो है येसबसे ज्यादा विषैलाहै अगर हमने विषैला पन जो है उसके आधार परअगर मैं देखूं तो सबसे ज्यादा विषैला कौनसा था बेटा जी आपका अमोनिया था ओके सर नोप्रॉब्लम अब मैं देख रहा हूं जल मेंघुलनशीलजल में घुलनशीलजल में घुलनशील के आधार पर मैं देख रहाहूं कि कौन सबसे ज्यादा जल में घुलनशील हैतो सेम कंडीशनअमोनिया जो है वो यूरिया से ज्यादा जल मेंघुलनशील है यूरिया जो है यूरिक अम्ल सेज्यादा घुलनशील है किसमें जल में अब मैंआपसे एक सिंपल सा प्रश्न पूछता हूं जरासामने देखिए मैंने क्या देखे दो आधार परदेखा अपशिष्ट पदार्थों को एक मैंने देखाविषैले पन के आधार पर एक मैंने देखा जलमें घुलनशील होता के आधार पर सबसे ज्यादाविषैला कौन अमोनिया और सबसे ज्यादा जल मेंघुलनशील भी कौन अमोनिया उससे कम विषैलाकौन यूरिया और जल में घुलनशील है लेकिनअमोनिया से कम है और इससे कम विषैला यूरिकअम्ल और जल में घुलनशील सबसे कम है कौनयूरिक अम्ल चलो सर ये चीज हमें समझ में आगई अब मेरा प्रश्न ये है ध्यान से सुननाएक जीव है एक जीव है जो पानी में मिल रहाहै एक जीव है जो स्थल पर मिल रहा है लेकिनपानी पी रहा है एक जीव जो स्थल पर मिल रहाहै पानी कम पी रहा है सिंपल से तीन बिंदुबोले मैंने मैंने बोला एक जीव जो पानी मेंरह रहा है एक जीव जो स्थल पर है लेकिनपानी पी रहा है एक जीव जो स्थल पर हैतीसरी कंडीशन स्थल पर है लेकिन पानी कम पीरहा है बहुत कम पी रहा है अब आप मुझेबताया वो जीव जो पानी में है उसके चारोंतरफ पानी है वो जीव जिनके अंदर अपशिष्टपदार्थ अमोनिया बनेगा अमोनिया जो जल्दी सेजल में घुल जाएगा तो क्या कोई स्पेसिफिकअंग की जरूरत पड़ेगी या सीधा त्वचा सेअमोनिया निकल जाएगा सीधा पानी में घुल कररबाहर सोचिए मैं एक ऐसा जीव हूं जो पानीमें मिल रहा हूं मेरे अंदर क्या बनाअमोनिया बना ध्यान से सुनना मेरे अंदरक्या बना अमोनिया बना ओके सर सबसे ज्यादाहानिकारक कौन है अमोनिया ये सबसे पहलेबनता है सबसे पहले फर्स्ट हम किसी भी शरीरमें सबसे पहला अपशिष्ट पदार्थ क्या बनताहै अमोनिया उसके बाद बनता है यूरिया औरउसके बाद बन रहा है यूरिक अम्ल ठीक है अबजरा इमेजिन करिए मैं किसम मिल रहा हूंपानी में मेरे अंदर क्या बना अमोनिया क्यामुझे अमोनिया को यूरिया में बदलने कीजरूरत है नहीं सर मेरे अंदर क्या बनाअमोनिया मेरे चारों तरफ क्या मिल रहा हैजल मैंने अपना अमोनिया निकाल दिया किसमेंजल में घुल गया और फटाफट निकल गया जरासोचिए ऐसे जीव जो अमोनिया निकालेंगे उनकोहम क्या बोलेंगे अमोनिया उत्सर्जी बोलेंगेकि नहीं बोलेंगे बोलेंगे ना तो बेटा येपहली लाइन यहां पर यही तो लिखी हुई है किसबसे ज्यादा सर्वाधिक टॉक्सिक जो होता हैविषैला जो होता है वो कौन होता है अमोनियाऔर इसको निकालने के लिए ज्यादा से ज्यादाजल की जरूरत होती है और ये जल्दी जल मेंघुल भी जाता है बहुत ज्यादा जल भी चाहिएऔर ये जल्दी जल में घुल भी जाता है ऐसेजीव जो इस प्रक्रिया को दर्शाए उन्हें हमक्या बोलेंगे अमोनिया उत् उत् सर्जी ऐसेजीवों को हम क्या बोलेंगे अमोनियाउत्सर्जी बोलेंगे अमोनोटलिक बोलेंगे सरकौन होते हैं याद रखना भूल ना जाइएगा अथिलमछलियां सर अथिल मछलियां कौन सी होती हैयाद कर पढ़ाया हुआ है प्राणी जगत में अथिलमछलियां जिनके अंदर क्या होती है अस्थियांहोती है याद कर

वो जीवजो यूरिया निकालेंगे अब जरा सोचिए जैसेजैसे इवोल्यूशन हुआ जीव पानी से निकल निकलकर कहां पर आए स्थल पर आए आए ना स्थल परजब आए आए जैसे हम स्थल पर आए है ना हमारेअंदर बनता क्या है सर हमारे अंदर अमोनियाबनता है लेकिन हमारे चारों तरफ पानी हैक्या हम अपनी त्वचा से अमोनिया निकालकरसीधा पानी में डाल दे नहीं ना नहीं नालेकिन हम पानी पीते हैं हां सर पीते हैंतो जरा सोच दिमाग लगाए हमारे अंदर अमोनियाबना हां बना और अमोनिया हमारे लिए बहुत हीज्यादा हानिकारक है तो क्या करना पड़ेगाहमें इस अमोनिया को बदलना पड़ेगा किसमेंयूरिया में और प्रभु यह काम कहां पर होताहै यकृत में होता होता है याद रखना लीवरमें होता है कि लीवर में लीवर में अमोनियाको किसमें बदला जाता है यूरिया में एकचक्र होता है जो हमारी एनसीआरटी में लिखानहीं हुआ जिसका नाम होता है ऑर्थनॉर्मलबोलते हैं किडनी बोलते हैं उन किडनी केअंदर जाता है वो रक्त उस रक्त में सेयूरिया को छाना जाता है और जल में मिलायाजाता है जो हम पानी पीते हैं ना उसमेंमिलाया जाएगा और क्या बनाया जाएगा यूरियाप्लस वाटर मिलकर क्या बनेगा यूरीन यानीमूत्र बनेगा फिर उस मूत्र को त्याग

यूरिया उत्सर्जी होते हैं सर येयूरिया कहां पर बनता है मैंने आपको बतादिया कहां पर बनता है कृत में अमोनिया कोयूरिया में बदला जाता है यकृत में भूलनाजाइएगा सिंपल और फिर वो यकृत से होता हुआरक्त में आता है रक्त को छाना जाता हैकिसम किडनी में रक्त छने उसमें से क्यानिकाल लिया जाएगा यूरिया वाटर के साथ जलके साथ मिक्स करके यूरीन बनाया जाएगा खत्मखल्लास आखरी तीसरे तीसरी जो कैटेगरी है वोकौन है यूरिक अम्लउत्सर्जी यूरिक अम्ल उत्सर्जी का मतलब जोयूरिक अम्ल निकालेंगे अब साहब जरा सोचिएयह ऐसे जीव होंगे जिनको ज्यादा पानी कीजरूरत नहीं है है ना अब जरा सोचिए मैं एकऐसा जीव जो स्थल पर हूं और बहुत कम पानीपी रहा हूं है ना अब मेरे अंदर जो अपशिष्टपदार्थ बना वो क्या बना सर मेरे अंदर बनाथा अमोनिया मैंने कहा ओके ध्यान से सुननामेरे अंदर क्या बना अमोनिया मैंने उसअमोनिया को यकृत में ही बदला किसम यूरिकअम्ल में कंफ्यूज हो गए ना मैंने अमोनियाको किसम बदल दिया यकृत में हीबदला मैंने अमोनिया को बहुत ही कमहार्मफुल बहुत ही कम विषैले पदार्थ किसमेंबदल दिया यूरिक एसिड में बदल दिया मेरेअंदर कहां पर बदला ये यकृत में बदला मेरेअंदर मतलब मान लो मैं एक जीव हूं ठीक हैकनेक्ट करना बेटा अगर कनेक्ट नहीं करेंगेतो समझ में नहीं आएगा देखिए मैं एक ऐसाजीव था पानी में मिल रहा था मुझे अमोनियाको ना यूरिया में ना ही यूरिक अम्ल में डलबदलने की जरूरत थी क्योंकि अमोनिया सीधापानी में घुल जाता है मेरे चारों तरफ पानीथा मैंने अपना अमोनिया निकालकर पानी मेंडाल दिया और पानी में घुल करर अमोनियानिकल गया मेरे शरीर से खत्म फिर मैंनेबोला मैं स्थल पर आया स्थल पर मैं रह रहाहूं और मेरे अंदर जो अमोनिया जो बहुतहार्मफुल है मैंने उसको बदला यूरिया मेंक्यों क्योंकि मेरे चारों तरफ पानी तो हैनहीं लेकिन मैं पानी पी सकता हूं पानी कीजरूरत है मुझे मैंने अंदर पानी गया मेरेअंदर यूरिया जो था इस यूरिया को मैंनेपानी में मिक्स करके क्या बना दिया यूरिनबना दिया मूत्र बना दिया और निकाल दियाठीक है अब मैंने बोला मैं स्थल पर तो हूंलेकिन मुझे ज्यादा पानी की जरूरत नहीं हैमेरे अंदर अमोनिया को किसम बदल दिया गयाहै यूरिक अम्ल में बदल दिया गया है अब जरासोचिए पानी बहुत कम गया है ना के बराबरगया है बहुत कम तो ये जो यूरिक जो होएगायह जो मूत्र जो निकलेगा जरा सोचिए बहुत हीगाढ़ा होगा कि नहीं होगा सोचिए या बहुत हीसांद्र होगा सोचिए दिमाग लगाए है सॉरीसांद्र होगा या तनु होगा कंसंट्रेटेड होगाकि डाइल्यूट होगा ओबवियस बात है बहुतज्यादा सांद्र होएगा बहुत ही ज्यादाकंसंट्रेटेड होएगा एक पेस्ट के रूप मेंनिकलेगा बालक यही चीज यहां पर बता रखी हैपेस्ट के रूप में निकलता है क्या बेटा जीआपका यूरिक अम्ल अब साब ऐसे जी जो होतेहैं वो कौन होते हैं आपको समझ में आ गयाकौन यूरक यूरिक अम्ल उत्सर्जी यूरिकोटेलिकबोलते सर यह कौन से होते हैं याद रखना हैसरी सर्प पक्षी स्थलीय घोंगे औरकीट बेटा यहां से प्रश्न उठता है इसचैप्टर में याद रखना भूल ना जाइएगाउदाहरणों से प्रश्न पूछ लेगा तुमसे घोंगाक्या उत्सर्जक

एंटीनल ग्लैड्स याद रखना येसिर्फ नाम है नाम है नाम है ये याद रखनेहै तो यहां से यहां तक हमने पढ़ा किअपशिष्ट पदार्थ क्या होते हैं कौन से जीवक्या निकालते हैं और उत्सर्जन अंगों केबारे में याद रखना है अब आगे बढ़ते हैंबेटा जी इसके बाद में अगला जो टॉपिक आताहै वो आता है मानव उत्सर्जन तंत्र सीधा जोअगला टॉपिक आता है वो क्या आता है मानवउत्सर्जन तंत्र की जब हम बात करते हैं तोबेटा हमारा उत्सर्जन तंत्र जो होता है वहचार चीजों से मिलकर बना होता है एक जोड़ीकिडनी प्रत्येक किडनी से निकलती हुई मूत्रनलिका दोनों मूत्र नलिका किसम जाकर खुलतीहै एक ब्लैडर में जिसके अंदर मूत्र इकट्ठाहोता है जिसको हम क्या बोलते हैं मूत्राशयऔर फिर मूत्राशय से एक क्या निकलता हैमूत्रमार्ग यूरेथ्रा सर अंग्रेजी में क्याबोलते हैं बेटा किडनी को तो बोला जा वृकको क्या बोला जाता हैकिडनी मूत्र नलिका या मूत्र वाहिनी कोबोला जाता है बेटा जी याद रखनायूरेटर मूत्राशय को बोला जाता हैयूरिनरीब्लेडर और मूत्र मार्ग को बोला जाता हैयूरेथ्राठीक है सो कुल मिलाकर यह चार भाग जो होतेहैं मिलकर क्या बनाते हैं मानव उत्सर्जनतंत्र जरा देख ली यही लिखा हुआ है मनुष्यमें उत्स तंत्र एक जोड़ी वृक यानी किडनीएक जोड़ी मूत्र नलिका यानी प्रत्येक किडनीसे एक नलिका यानी एक जोड़ी नलिका एकमूत्राशय और एक मूत्र मार्ग देख लो भाई एकजोड़ी किडनी प्रत्येक किडनी से एक जोड़ीक्या निकली मूत्र नलिका दोनों मूत्र नलिकाकिसम आके खुली एक मूत्राशय एक मूत्राशय सेनिकला क्या मूत्र मार्ग खत्म तो यह चारचीजें मिलकर क्या बना रहे हमारा उत्सर्जनतंत्र बना रहे हैं चलिए अब मेन कौन है भाईमेन तो यही है ना अरे प्रभु मेन तो ये हैकौन है किडनी यही तो पढ़नी है किडनी तोकाम कर रही है इसी किडनी में ही तो यूरिनबनेगा इसी किडनी में ही तो मूत्र बनेगाचलिए अब किडनी के बारे में यहां पर जो जोचीजें लिखी हुई है वो सारी की सारी आपनेयाद रखनी है प्रभु इसमें देखिए कुछ भीदोहराए नहीं है ये सारी की सारी आपनेडायमेंशन याद रखनी है सेम के आकार की होतीहै सेम की फली के आकार की होती है भूरेरंग की होती है सेम के बीज के

समझ में नहीं आती आई होपइतनी सी बात समझ में आ गई होगी बाकी कितनीलंबाई होती है 10 से 12 सेंटीमीटर चौड़ाई5 से 7 सेंटीमीटर मोटाई दो से 3 सेंटीमीटरऔर लगभग 120 से 170 ग्राम इनका क्या होताहै भार होता है ओके यहां तक की चीज समझमें आ गई अब इसके आगे की जो चीज जो हैउसको मेरे को डायग्राम से बताना पड़ेगा यहवाला जो डायग्राम है इससे समझाना पड़ेगाआइए समझते हैं बेटा देखिए हमारी किडनी जोहोती है वह सेम के आकार की होती है यह तोआपको समझ में आ गया अब इसमें यह वाला जोभाग जो होताहै येवाला यह वाला भाग जो होता है इसको हमबोलते हायलम जल्दी से ध्यान से सुनना क्याबोलते हैंहायलम ठीक है इसी हायलम से बाहर निकलती हैमूत्र नलिका भाई जरा सोचिए अंदर मूत्रबनेगा हां बनेगा और मूत्र बाहर नहींनिकालेंगे निकालेंगे ना तो किडनी से एक एककिडनी से एक मूत्र नलिका नहीं निकल रहीनिकल रही है अब साहब किडनी के अंदर मूत्रअगर निर्माण करना है तो ब्रेन नियंत्रितनहीं करेगा तंत्रिका तंत्र नियंत्रितकरेगा तो अंदर तंत्रिका भी तो जाएगी हांसर तंत्रिका जाएगी अब जरा सोचिए अंदरकोशिका उन कोशिकाओं को रक्त नहीं देना हैशुद्ध रक्त नहीं देना ऑक्सी रक्त नहींदेना बिल्कुल देना है तो अंदर क्या जाएगीसर रक्त नलिका भीजाएगी और रक्त नलिका धमनी अगर जाएगी तोबाहर शिरा नहीं निकलेगी बिल्कुल निकलेगीतो धमनी अंदर गई शिरा बाहर आई यह क्याकहला रही है सर रक्त नलिकाहै तो कुल मिलाकर रक्त नलिका मूत्रनलिका औरतंत्रिका है ना ये सारी की सारी जो है येइस क्षेत्र से अंदर जा रही है या बाहर आरही है बाहर कौन मूत्र नलिका बाहर कौनशेरा अंदर कौन धमनी अंदर कौन तंत्रिका डनना डन च अब ये जो क्षेत्र था इसका नामक्या था बेटा हायलम था येहायलम इस तरीके से कीप आकार की संरचना बनारहा है यह हायलम जो है इस तरीके से कीपआकार की संरचना बना रहा है इस संरचना कोबोला जाता हैपेल्विस क्या बोला जाता है

वृक को दोभागों में बांट दिया है किसको हमने इसकिडनी को कुल मिलाकर कुल मिलाकर हमने इसकिडनी को दो भागों में बांट दियाहै एक तो हरा वाला भाग है जो किनारे परमिल रहा है और एक पीला वाला भागहै जिसमेंयह सारे भाग जो मैंने वर्ड बोले वो सारेके सारे आ रहे हैं जिसके अंतर्गतआपका पेल्विस आता है चक्क आते हैं और वृकपिरामिड आते हैं ठीक है कौन-कौन[संगीत]यह पिरामिड आगए ठीक है जी और यह आपकेतो ये सारा भाग अंदर वाला और ये हरा वालाक्षेत्र किनारे वाला हरे वाला क्षेत्रक्या कहलाता हैवलक और वोह अंदर पीला वाला भाग क्याकहलाता हैमध्या आई होप आपको यह चीज समझ में आ गईहोगी इसमें कोई कंफ्यूजन नहीं होगा ठीक हैचलिए सर यहां तक की बात समझ में आ गई अबमैं आपसे पूछ रहा हूं जरा देखिएगा वलक कावो भाग जो मध्यांचलकुट का कुछ भाग मध्यांचलके बीच में दिखाई दे रहा हैचक्षु हरा वाला है हां सर उसका कुछक्षेत्र ऐसा है जो आपको चक्क के बीच मेंदिखाई दे रहा है ये देखिए येवाला हां सर थोड़ा सा ज्यादा हरा कर दियाहैमैंने है ना ऐसा नहीं लग रहा है स्तंभ सेबन रहे हैं स्तंभ बन रहे हैं बन रहे हैंइनको बोला जाता है बतीनी के स्तंभक्या बोला जाता है यह

अच्छाएक और चीज ये किडनी एक आवरण से ढकी रहतीहै क्या बोला हमने किडनी जो है एक आवरण सेढकी रहती है जिसको हम संपुट बोलते हैंसंपुट ठीक है अब मेन चीज क्या है प्रभुमेन चीज है क्या इसके अंदर वो संरचना जोमूत्र का निर्माण करेगी जिनका नाम होता हैव्रुजेंड मेन चीज है क्या वो वोसंरचनात्मक व क्रियात्मक इकाई जो मूत्र कानिर्माण करने वाली इस किडनी में साब यहांपर मूत्र का निर्माण होएगा कैसे कौन करेगातो आइए वह संरचना जो मूत्र का निर्माणकरती है वह कौन सी होते देखिएगा कुछ इसतरीकेसे दिख रही हैसंरचनायह संरचना दिख रही इनको बोला जाता हैवक्रासन वृ काण वृकाण वृ[संगीत]काणुवनरक्त आएगा हां सर आएगा फिर से सुनो देखोमैंने खाना

अमोनिया को किसम बदलायूरिया में बदला ओके सर लीवर ने उस यूरियाको निकालकर रक्त में डाल दिया ओके सर वोरक्त अंदर आया अंदर आया रक्त अंदर आकररक्त जो है उस रक्त में से छाना जाएगाकिसको यूरिया को और जल के साथ मिक्स कियाजाएगा और क्या बनाया जाएगा यूरीन फिर वोयूरीन इनके अंदर य जो संरचना है ना वृ काणइन्हीं के अंदर यूरिन बनता है फिर यहसंरचनाओं से यूरीन निकलकर यहां आता औरयहां से मूत्र नलिका लेकर चली जाती हैमूत्राशय में जाता है स्टोर होता है फिरमूत्र मार्ग से बाहर चला जाता है यह सिंपलसी बात थी समझने लायक डन कोई दिक्कत तोनहीं है अब मेन कौन है यही तो समझना हैइसकी संरचना को समझना है किसकी वृक्का कोइस वृ काण को ही तो समझना क्योंकि इसी मेंही तो मूत्र का निर्माण होने वाला तो यहहै कौनवण यह है कौन वृ काण यह व्रण है दिख रहीहै सर इनमें से वृक्का कौन सी अभीसमझाएंगे आपको कौन सी वृक्का उससे पहले एकडायग्राम ये भी हमारी एनसीआरटी में है नातो आइए उससे पहले एक बार यहां पर जो चीजेंलिखी हुई है यहां तक ये देखिए ये सारी चीजहायलम बता दिया श्रोणी बता दिया प्रक्षेपजो बाहर निकल रहे हैं चक्क कैलिक्स बतादिया वलक बता

किडनी मेंकितनी 10 लाख मेरे 10 लाख इस किडनी में 10लाख सर फिक्स्ड होती है कि 10 लाख नहींनहीं ऊपर नीचे हो सकती है 1 लाख 2 लाख ऊपरहो गई या हजारों में कुछ ऊपर हो गई तोऔसतन जो है वो 10 लाख है एक किडनी मेंदूसरी किडनी में भी लगभग 10 लाख यानी 20लाख एवरेज औसतन क्या मिलती है हमारे अंदरवृक के अंदर वृक्का मिलती है नलिका कासंरचना होती है नेफ्रॉन बोलते हैं और यहीक्रियात्मक इकाई है यही क्रिया करेगी यहीमूत्र का निर्माण करेगी अब सबब ये वृकाणुवनदेखेगा वृ काणबेटाबताइएगा देखकरमुझे यह वृकाणुवनकरिए क्या आपको एक नली का का नली नहीं दिखरही है देखिए यह पूरी क्या है नली है हांसर यह भी नीचे क्या है य आकार की नली हैहां सर सर ये घूमती हुई नली है देखिए जैसेयह भी घू नली घूम गई है यह भी घूम रही हैयह य आकार की संरचना और फिर फाइनली एकआखिरी नलिका में खुले हैं और उससे पहले यहकप शेप की कप शेप की संरचना है जिसमेंधोरा आवरण हैय बाह्य आवरण है और एक अंतआवरण दो आवरण है ठीक है तो यह तो हो गईक्या वृक नलिका यह क्या हो गई वृक नलिकाहो गई सर इनका नाम क्या होता है वृक नलिकाका ध्यान से सुनना यह वाला भाग कहलाता हैबोमनसंपट क्या

बोलिए तो यहां पर हमने क्या बोला1100 से 1200 एमएल क्या आ रहा था रक्त आरहा था ये अभी वाही धमनी का लेकर आ रही थीएक रक्त लेकर आ रही है आ रही है और ये जोटोटल रक्त आ रहा है इसमें से 650 एमएल कौनहै प्लाज्मा है अब ये जो 650 एमएल यहां परजो प्लाज्मा पहुंची है इस टोटल रक्त में650 देख 1100 से 1200 एमएल कौन है ब्लड हैऔर उस ब्लड में जो 1100 से 1200 एमएल ब्लडआ रहा है उसमें 650 एमएल कौन है प्लाज्माइतनी सी बात खोपड़ी में बैठी बैठ गई पानीआ रहा है पानी आ रहा है 1100 से 1200 एमएलजिसमें 650 एए कौन है प्लाज्मा बस पानीनहीं मतलब सॉरी रक्त रक्त 1100 से 1200 एएउस रक्त में 650 एए कौन है प्लाज्मा यहांपर पहुंची उन 650 एए में से 125 एए नीचेछनगई 125 एए नीचे छन गए और यह सारा काम किसमें हो रहा है एक मिनट में 1 मिनट में1100 से 1200 एए क्या आ रहा है रक्त आ रहाहै उस रक्त में उस रक्त में वर्ड ध्यान सेसुनना उस 1100 से 1200 एमए रक्त में 650एए कौन है प्लाज्मा है वो 650 एमएलप्लाज्मा में से नीचे कितनी छन रही है 125एमएल छन रही है बाकी 425 एमएल नहीं छन पाईकौन प्लाज्मा क्यों नहीं छन पाई है क्योंनहीं छन पाई पूछेंगे ना सर क्यों नहीं छनपाई तो प्रभु ये जो ग्लोमर अस जो होता हैना गुच्छ इस गुच्छ में होते हैं छिद्र औरउन छिद्रों से प्रोटीन नहीं छन पा रहे थेकिसके प्लाज्मा के जो चीज छन सकती थी उनछिद्रों से व छन गई और कितनी छन रही हैप्रति मिनट 125 एमएल नीचे आईहै अब आप बोलेंगे सर य 125 एमल यहां सेहोती हुई यहां से होती हुई यहां से होतीहुई यहां से होती हुई यहां से होती हुईयहां से होती ई यहां से होती हु यहांपहुंचेगीऔर यहां पर मैं आपसे बोल रहा हूं मूत्रहोताहै इस संग्रह नलिका में क्या बन जाता हैमूत्र बन जाता है तो सर क्या 25 एमए जोछना था यहां पर गुच्छ से बोमन संपुट फिरपीसीटी फिर एन लेल फिरडीसीटीएल छना था क्या वो 125 एए पहुंचताहै नहीं कितना पहुंचता है लगभग 1.25एए 1.25 एए अब थोड़ा सा अगर कॉमन सेंसलगाएंगे 125 एए छना कौन प्लाज्मा जिसमेंयूरिया वरिया वो सब था 125 एए यहां परपहुंचा इसमें से इसमें से पहुंचते पहुंचतेपहुंचते यहां पर कितना पहुंचा 125 में सेकेवल 1.25 पहुंचाहै यानी केवल 1 पर ही तो पहुंचा है नहींनहीं न 125 का 1 पर कितना होएगा 1.25 नहींहोएगा तो मैंने क्या बोला भैया 125 एए छनाहां छने के बाद यहां से यहां से घूमतेघूमते हैले लू से फिरडीसीटीएल आया क्या आया मूत्र आया बाकी सर1 पर ही तो आया बाकी 99 प्र कहां गया वोजो 99 पर जो चीज यहां पर आई थी वह कहां गईवो1237512.75 एमएल जो चीज जो थी वो कहा कगई तो वो चीज यहां से पीसीटी से बाहरनिकली नले लूप से बाहर निकली डीसी टी सेबाहर निकली उसका कियाअवशोषण उनको निकाला बाहर किससे पीसीटी सेबाहर निकाला हेले लूप से बाहर निकालाडीसीटीआर आ गया हां सर यहां पर आ गया वोपदार्थ हां सर ये आ गया यहां पर आ गया येआ गया यहां पर वो पदार्थ जो यहां से छनछना करर यहां पर आ रहा था वो आ गयाबाहर वो यूजफुल चीज थी वो लाभदायक चीज थीजो यहां से छन गई थी तो क्या करा हमनेउसका अवशोषण किया हा बाहर निकाला और निकालकर ध्यान से सुनना निकाल लिया और निकाल करफिर उसकोहमने वापससे वापस से देख यह पीली नलिका में यहां सेपीली नलिका में डाल दिया अब इमेजिन कर वोपीली नलिका और ये लाल वाली वास रेक्ट मेंहमने डाल दिया यह क्या क लाएगा अवशोषण केपुनः अवशोषण पुनः पहले एक बार बाहर निकालाअवशोषण निकालकर फिर से डाल दिया पुनःअवशोषण तो हमने जो 125 एमएल में से 1.25एमए तो मूत्र बनाने के लिए यूज में लियायानी देख देख देख सीधी सी बात है समझ बालकबहुत सारा कंफ्यूजन होता है बच्चों कोबहुत सारा क्योंकि पहले कभी ध्यान से पढ़ानहीं होगा सुना नहीं होगा अगर पहले पढ़ाहुआ है 11वीं कक्षा में आराम से समझ में आजाएगा देख यहां से 1100 से 1200 एमएल क्याआया रक्त आया और ओबवियस सी बात है 1100 से1200 एमएल क्या आया रक्त आया उस रक्त मेंलगभग 650 एमएल क्या थी सर प्लाज्मा थीमैंने कहा ओके कितनी प्लाज्मा थी 650 एमए650 एमए नीचे 650 एमए में से नीचे कितनीछनी 125 एए छन गई है बाकी नहीं छन पाईक्योंकि यहां पर जो छिद्र थे वो छने नहींदे रहे थे बड़े-बड़े प्रोटीन थे नहीं छनपाए वो यहां से इधर चले गए हैं इधर चले गएहैं आरबीसी चली गई डब्ल्यूबीसी चली गईप्लेटलेट्स चली गई प्लाज्मा जो नहीं छनावो चला गया ठीक है तो सर यहां पर नीचे जोछना है वो क्या है देख उसमें अपशिष्टपदार्थ भी है यूरिया भी है यूरिक अम्ल भीहोता है थोड़ा बहुत अमोनिया भी होता हैथोड़ा बहुत मेजर्ली यूरिया है और सोडियमआयन पोटेशियम आयन बहुत सारी चीजें हैंआपके अमीनो अम्ल भी हैं ग्लूकोज भी हैबहुत सारी चीजें यानी जो चीज छनी है नाउसमें हार्मफुल चीज भी है और यूजफुल चीजभी थी है यानी क्या यह निसन जो थाफिल्ट्रेशन जो था क्या यह सिलेक्टिव थासिलेक्टिव का मतलब कि जो खराब चीजें केवलउसको ही नीचे छानना है नहीं ये नॉनसिलेक्टिव था नॉन सिलेक्टिव का मतलब कियहां पर ये नहीं देखा जा रहा कि किसकोछाने गे किसको नहीं यहां पर जो चीज छनसकती है छन गई छिद्रों से और वो जो चीजछनी है वो यूजफुल भी है और हार्मफुल भी हैहमें तो हार्मफुल चीज को कलेक्ट करना हैऔर मूत्र बनाना है यूजफुल चीज को थोड़ी नामूत्र के द्वारा निकालना है तो यूजफुल चीजको हमें क्या करना पड़ेगा वापस से खींचनापड़ेगा तो इन नलिका से जब वो चीज छन रहीथी 125 एमएल जब जा रहा था यहां से उस 125एमएल में से कुछ यहां से बाहर निकल गयाफिर यहां नले लूप की अवरोही भुजा से निकलगया आरोही भुजा से निकलगया बाहर निकलता जरहा इस जगह पर डी सटी सेबाहर निकल गया यूजफुल चीजें यूजफुल चीजेंनिकलती जा रही है और निकल निकल कर बाहर आगई है यहां से हमने इनको अवशोषित कर लियायहां से अवशोषित अवशोषित अवशोषित करकेबाहर निकाल लिया ये क्या कहलाएगा अवशोषणतो पुनः अवशोषण फिर से अवशोषित करेंगे अबयहां से निकाल कर कहां डालेंगे साहब येकौन थी याद कर ये कौन थी अपवाह धमनिया जोकिसम बदली परि नलि के केशिका में ये पीलापीला भाग है ये वास रेक्ट इसी का ही भागहै ये पीला पीला वही परि इन सब के अंदरडाल देंगे तो ये प्रक्रिया क्या कहलाए गीपुण शोषण जो यूजफुल चीज है हमने उसको वापससे कलेक्ट कर लिया और जो हार्मफुल चीज थीयहां से चलते चलते चलते चलते यहां परपहुंची और यहां पर क्या बन गया मूत्र बनगया खत्म ये क्या कहलाएगा पुनः अवशोषणपुनः अवशोषण तो कुल मिलाकर दो चरण हो गएहैं किस चीज के बेटा मूत्र निर्माण के एकहो गया क्या मेरे भाई एक हो गया क्या निसेंदन हो गया एक हो गया पुनः अवशोषण और एकतीसरा होता है जिसे हम क्या बोलते हैंस्रावण देख लो यही चीज जो मैंने आपको बोलीहै गुच्छ से क्या करना है नीसन करना हैछानना है 1100 से 1200 एमएल आता है जिसमेंसे 1 ब पाचवा हिस्सा आ रहा है हृदय से बतादिया था मैंने आपको ठीक है ये यहां से छनहोता है छन के बाद कितना छन रहा है देखयहां पर 125 एए प्रति मिनट की दर से छनरहा है अब जरा सोच 1 मिनट में अगर 125 एएछन रहा है तो एक दिन में कितना होएगा आपनिकाल सकते हैं 1 मिनट में 125 तो 1 घंटेमें कितना 125 * 60 1 दिन में कितना 1 दिनमें कितना 125 * 60 *24 लगभग180000 एमएल आएगा जिसको अगर हम लीटर मेंबदलेंगे तो कितना हो जाएगा 180 लीटर वहीलिखा हुआ इतनी कैलकुलेशन आप कर सकते हैंतो यानी एक दिन में एक दिन में अगर मैंदेखूं तो एक दिन में मेरे यहां से सोचनाथोड़ा कॉमन सेंस लगाओ यार थोड़ा सा कॉमनसेंस इस गुच्छ से एक मिनट में कितनीप्लाज्मा छन रही है 125 एए एक दिन में अगरनिकालनी होगी तो कैसे निकालेंगे1 मिनट में 125 तो 1 घंटे में कितना 125 *60 1 घंटे में आ जाएगी क्योंकि 1 घंटे मेंकितने है 60 मिनट है ना 1 मिनट में इतनीतो 1 घंटे में कितनी125 * 60 ओके एक दिन में कितनी 125 * 60 *24 24 घंटे होते हैं खत्म तो आंसर कितनाआएगा 180000 एए इसको अगर मैं 180000 एए कोलीटर में बदलूंगा तो कितना हो जाएगा 180लीटर यानी एक दिन में मेरी किडनी में 180लीटर प्लाज्मा छन रही है थोड़ा सा कॉमनसेंस लगा 180 लीटर यार 1 लीटर की पेप्सीकी बोटल इतनी सी होती है 180 लीटर तोप्लाज्मा छन रहा है सोच कॉमन सेंस लगा 180लीटर प्लाज्मा छन रहा है तो यहां पर अगर180 लीटर पहुंच जाता तो मैं तो बेटा पूरादिन बाथरूम में ही बैठा रहता पूरा दिन मुतमुत निकलता रहता हैं 180 लीटर पूरे दिनहैं सोचो समझ रहे तो जरा सोचिए 125 एमएप्रति मिनट या 180 लीटर प्रति दिन केहिसाब से यहां पर कितना पहुंचा अगर उतनाही पहुंच जाता तो ये तो गलत हो जाता ना तोयहां पर यूजफुल चीजों को निकालना पड़ेगाऔर निकालने की इस प्रक्रिया को हम क्याबोल रहे हैं पुनः अवशोषण बोल रहे हैंअच्छा एक और चीज ये जो नता है ना इसको हमबोलते हैंजीएफआर ये वर्ड याद रखना क्या बोलता है येजो छन र है इसको हम क्या बोलते हैं जीएफआरगुच्छी नी सदन दर ग्लोमर ग्लोमरफिल्ट्रेशन रेट बोलते हैं ग्लोमरफिल्ट्रेशनटग्लोमरफिल्ट्रेशनरेट जीएफ आर बोलते हैं कि जिस दर सेग्लोमर से यानी गुच्छ से छन छन रहा हैक्या प्लाज्मा विदाउट प्रोटीन यादरखना प्रोटीन को छोड़कर प्लाज्मा का साराका सारा भाग नीचे छन होता है ठीक है अब छनछना गया छन छना गया इतनी सारी चीजें छन गईअब इतनी सारी चीजों में से कुछ लाभदायक भीहोंगी और जो लाभदायक होंगी उनका क्या होजाएगा 999 प्र देखो साफ-साफ लिखा हुआ है99 प्र जो छना है वो पुनः अवशोषित कर लियाजाएगा और इस प्रक्रिया को बोला जाएगा पुनःअवशोषण अब ये पुनः अवशोषण बेटा सक्रिय भीहो सकता है निष्क्रिय भी हो सकता है जैसेग्लूकोज अमीनो अम्ल सोडियम आयन सक्रिय रूपसे होते हैं जबकि नाइट्रोजन स जबकि जो जलजो होता है वो निष्क्रिय रूप से अवशोषितहोता है यानी कुल मिलाकर पुनः अवशोषण जोथा वो सक्रिय निष्क्रिय दोनों रूप से होसकता है अब आखिरी जो चीज जो होती है वोहोती है स्रावण सर ये स्रावण क्या होताहै ये स्रावण क्या होता है देख ध्यान सेसुनो मैंने तुम्हें यहां पर बताया इधरथोड़ा सा मैं पीछे ले जाऊंगा मैंनेतुम्हें यहां पर बताया देख वापस से सुननापूरी कहानी को फिर से समझना फिर से समझेगातो सारी चीजें क्लियर होएगी देख यहां पररक्त आया आया कितना वापस से आराम सेतसल्ली से सुनना ध्यान से कंसंट्रेशन पूरीकी पूरी यहांपर कितना आया किडनी में 1100 से 1200 एमएआया ओके 1100 से 1200 एमए जो आया है उस1100 से 1200 एमए रक्त में 650 एमएल कौनहै प्लाज्मा क्योंकि टोटल रक्त का 55 परकौन होता है प्लाज्मा तो ये जो 1100 से1200 एमए आ रहा है इसी 1100 से 1200 एमएमें 650 एमए कौन है प्लाज्मा ओके ये यहांपर पहुंची 650 एमए प्लाज्मा हां इसमें से125 एमएल नीचे छन गई है बाकी नहीं छन पाईहै क्योंकि यहां पर जो छिद्र जो होंगेजिनको हम स्लिट पोर्स बोलते हैं क्याबोलते स्लिट पोर्स बोलते स्लिट पोर्स देखयहां पर वर्ड भी मिल जाएगा कहां है स्लिटपोर्स कहां गया हा स्लिटपोर्स खाच छिद्र दिख रहा है ये जो स्लिटपोर्स जो होंगे यहांपर ये जो स्लिट पोर्स होंगे य छिद्र जोंगेजिससे ये नीचे छने क्या प्लाज्मा विदाउटप्रोटीन प्लाज्मा छने का लेकिन उसमेंप्रोटीन नहीं छन क्योंकि छिद्रों का आकारइतना छोटा है कि उसमें प्रोटीन नहीं छनपाएंगे चलिए जी नीचे छन गया छन गया छन केबाद नीचे आया कौन आया सर नीचे आया कौन आयाभैया प्लाज्मा आया जिसमें यूजफुल चीज भीहै हार्मफुल भी है हमें इस हार्मफुल मेंसे यूजफुल चीज को बाहर निकाल लिया निकालतेजा रहे हैं पीसीटी से निकाल लिया नले लूपसे निकाल लियाजो हार्मफुल चीज थी उसको खिसका खिसकाखिसका यहां ले आए हैं जल के साथ वह आया हैऔर क्या बन गया मूत्र बन गया और जो यूजफुलचीज थी उसको हमने यहां से बाहर निकालकरनिकाल लिया और बाहर निकालने के बाद उसकोपुनः पुनः किसम डाल दिया परि नलकीय केशिकामें ठीक है सर यह पुनः अवशोषण हो गया अबइधर ध्यान से सुनना सर हमने जो छाना थाक्या हमको यह पता है कि जो चीज छनी हैवाकई वो सारी की सारी अपशिष्ट पदार्थ नीचेछन गया नहीं हो सकता है कि कुछ अपशिष्टपदार्थ जो नहीं छन पाया सोचो हो सकता हैयहां से कुछ ऐसा पदार्थ होगा जो नीचे नहींछन पाया हो यहां आ गया हो किसम अभिवा मेंसॉरी अपवा में अपवा से किसम आ गया परिनलकीय केशिका में आ गया हो सकता है वासरेक्ट में भी हो है ना तो याद रखनापर्टिकुलर परी है केशिका जो

हो सकता है उसमें से कुछपदार्थ अभी भी अपशिष्ट हो जो नहीं छन पायाहो प्रॉपर्ली नीचे हमने क्या किया उसपदार्थ को निकालकर हमने पीसीटी और हमनेडीसीटीएल स्रावण कहला रही छानने कीप्रक्रिया नि सेंदन कहला रही थी अब जोयूजफुल चीज थी उसको हमने बाहर निकाल लियाथा और निकालकरहमने निकाल कर वो जो बाहर जो निकाल थाउसको हमने इन्हीं परि नलि कीय केशिका मेंडालदिया यह क्या कहलाएगा पुनः अवशोषण ये तीनप्रक्रिया हो रही है जिसके कारण फाइनलीमूत्र का निर्माण हो जाएगा अब ये संग्रहनलिका एं ध्यान से सुनना ये संग्रह नलिकाएं यहां से ये संग्रह नलिका ऐसे लगभग 4000संग्रह नलिका एं होती हैं एक किडनी मेंलगभग 4000 ये हमारी बुक में नहीं लिखा हुआलगभग 4000 संग्रह नलिका यहां से चक्क सेहोती हुई चक्षु सारी की सारी यहां पर आकरखुलती है और यहां पर मूत्र निकाल देती हैंऔर वो मूत्र इस मूत्र नलिका से होते हुएबाहर आ जाएगा ये थी पूरी प्रक्रिया किसकीमत्र निर्माण की और यह थी सारी चीजें जोमैंने आपको समझा दी हैं अभी कुछ और टॉपिकभी रह रहे हैं इस चैप्टर में वह आपकोसमझाने बाकी हैं मेरे दोस्त तो आज के लिएबेटा इतना ही है आज के लिए इतनी ही हम बातकरने वाले हैं ठीक है अभी समय हुआ है आपकेक्विज का पहला प्रश्न आपकी स्क्रीन पर आताहुआफर्स्ट अथिल मछलियां होती हैं याद करिएमैंने आपको समझाया था आपको बताया था किअथिल मछलियां कैसी हो हो अमोनिया उत्सर्जीहोती है यूरिया उत्सर्जी होती है यूरिकअम्ल उत्सर्जी होती है या कोई नहीं दिमागलगाइएसोचिए सोचिए अथिल मछलियां अस्थि टिकथीज टिक थीज अथिल मछलिया कैसीथीदूसरा प्रश्न प्रत्येक वृक में कितनी वृकाणुवनकितनी वृकाणुवनलगाएचलिए समय हुआ समाप्त आइए डिस्कस करते बेटामात्र दो ही प्रश्न पहला अथिल मछलिया होतीहै कैसी होती है याद कर यार आज सारा बतायातुमको यार कैसी थी अमोनिया उत्सर्जी नहींथी क्या बताया तो है यह देख अथिल मछलियाअमोनिया उत्सर्जी साफ साफ बताया है ठीक हैजी अथिल मछलिया कैसी होती है बेटा जी आपकीअमोनिया उत्सर्जी होती हैठीक है दूसरा एक वृक में लगभग कितनी वृकाण होती है ये देख यह भी बताया है कितनीय देख 10 लाख यह देख पीछे ले जाऊंगा फिरसे बताने के लिए कितनी होती है समझाया थाबता बताया था यहां पर कितनी 10लाख एक वृक में एक वृक में एक किडनी मेंकितनी है 10लाख आंसरइज खत्म तो अब इसके बाद अगला जो टॉपिक आताहै वो आता है वृक नलिका के विभिन्न भागोंके कार्य देख हमने वृक नलिका यानी वृकनलिका यानी व्रण यानी नेफ्रॉन उसकी जोनलिका हैं उनके कार्य क्या क्या है है नावह हम देखने वाले हैं तो सबसे पहलेसमीपस्थ संलित नलिका हैनले लूप दूरस्तसंवत नलिका और संग्रह नलिका इन चारों कीबात हमें करनी है तो पहले मैं एक बारडायग्राम बनाता हूं फिर आपको समझाता हूंदेख देखो यह हैहमारा बोमन संपुट ठीकहै और यह क्या थी बेटाहमारी कुंडलिक समीपस्थ संलित नलिकापीसीटी यह नले लूपहै यह इसकी अवरोही य आरोही भुजा यह हमऑलरेडी देख चुकेहैं ठीक है और यह क्या थी हमारी डीसी ठीकहै दिस इपीसीटी ये डी सटी और ये अवरोही और येआरोही अवरोही को इंग्लिश में क्या बोलेंगेडिसेंडिंग असेंडिंग ठीक है सो यहां तक कीबात सिंपल सी थी और यह कौन है हमारीसंग्रह नलिका ओके जी अब कुल मिलाकर हमनेक्या छाना था बेटा हमने यहां पर क्या लेकरआए थे बच्चे हम यहां पर अभिवा धमनिया लेकरआए और उस अभी वाही धमनी का ने एक गुच्छासा बनाया केशिका हों का है गुच्छ जिसकोग्लो मेरुल अस बोला जिससे हमने वापस सेक्या निकाली थी अपवाह धम निका निकाल दी थीठीक है हमने बोला इस गुच्छ में से जोपदार्थ प्लाज्मा छना था विदाउट प्रोटीननीचे छना था कितना 125 एमएल प्रति मिनटछना था जिसको हमने क्या बोला था जीएआर कितना था 125 मिनट अ सॉरी 125 एमएलप्रति मिनट है ना यही बोला था हां सर औरहमने यह बोला था कि यहां पर जो मूत्रबनेगायहां पर मूत्र बनेगा वो कितना है बेटायहां पर इस जीएफआर में से केवल 1 पर केवलएक पर भाग य जो जीएफआर जोय छन रहा था इसकाकेवल एक प्रतिशत भाग मूत्र बनाएगा यानी यजो छना है इसका केवल % पोर्शन जो है वहयूरीन बनाएगा केवल 1 पर भाग जो है वह क्याबनाएगा मूत्रबनाएगा यानी कितना हो गया 1.25 एमएल प्रतिमिनट यह भी हमने आपको बता दिया बाकी काक्या हुआ था याद करिए मैंने आपको बताया थाबाकी जो चीजें यहां से आ रहीहैं है ना यहां से होती हुई आ रही है उनबाकी चीजों मेंसे 99 प्र चीजों को हम बाहर निकालेंगेपीसीटी से निकाललिया निकालेंगेसिमिलरली अवरोही भुजा से निकालेंगे आरोहीभुजा से निकालेंगे डी सटी से निकालेंगे औरसंग्रह नलिका से भी निकालते हैं अबक्या-क्या निकालते हैं और सबसे ज्यादाकहां से निकालते हैं तो याद रखना सबसेपहले हमारा कौनपीसीटी समीपस्थ संवत नलिका सबसे पहलेपीसीटी याद रखना ये जो जीएफआर जो था 125एमएल प्रति मिनट इसमें से केवल 1 प्र भागजो है वो क्या बना रहा है मूत्र बना रहाहै यानी कितना 1 मिनट में 1.25 एमए यहांपर क्या बनेगा मूत्र बनेगा है ना बाकी 99प्र चीजों को हम बाहर निकाल रहे हैं निकालतो सबसे ज्यादा बाहर कहां से निकालते हैतो याद रखना पीसीटी से मैक्सिमम चीजों काअवशोषण अवशोषण बोल रहा हूं अभी पुन अवशोषणनहीं बोला मैंने क्या बोला अवशोषणअब्जॉर्प्शन सबसे ज्यादा कहां से होता हैयाद रखना अधिकतममैक्सिममअवशोषण यहां से होता हैसर किसका किसका अवशोषण होता है भाई साहबयाद रखना है आपने भूलना नहीं है आपने जलका भूलना नहीं सबसे पहले किसका जल का लगभग70 टू 80 पर इलेक्ट्रोलाइट्स का विद्युतअपघटक केमिस्ट्री में जानते हैं द्युत अपटहै ना सो 70 टू 80 पर वैद्युत अपघटक जल काहै ना और उसके साथ साथ उसके साथ साथ बाईकार्बोनेट्स का बाई कार्बोनेट्स का ठीक हैतो मुख्य रूप से आपने याद रखना जो भीउपयोगी चीजें हैं मैक्सिमम कौन-कौनजल 70 टू 80 पर आपके इलेक्ट्रोलाइट्सविद्युतअपघटन पोटेशियम क्लोरीन मैग्नीशियम येआयनिक रूप में जो मिलते हैं है नाऔर बाई कार्बोनेट्स ठीक है इन सभी काग्लूकोज का भी लिख देता हूं ग्लूकोजका ठीक है ग्लूकोज का हो गया तो इन सभीचीजों का सभी लवण लिख देता हूं लवण यह लोमैक्सिमम चीजों का अवशोषण लिखा है मैंनेअभी पु अवशोषण नहीं लिखा यह सारी की सारीचीजें मैक्सिमम चीजें 99 पर था देखिए जो आरहा था जो छन रहा था वो कितना वो क्याकहला रहा है जीएफआर जिसमें से केवल 1 परजीएफआर का केवल 1 पर भाग मूत्र बनाएगायानी जो चीज छन रही है उसमें से केवल 1 परयहां पर पहुंचेगी बाकी 99 पर कहां गई हमनेबाहर निकाल दी भाई हमने अब्जॉर्ब कर लियाअब शोषित कर लिया और बाहर निकाल दी है यहलीजिए यह बाहर निकाल दि यहां से बाहरनिकाल दी खत्म इतनी सी बात है अब सबसेज्यादा कहां से बाहर निकालिए पीसीटी सेबाहर निकाल दिया खत्म इतनी सी बात है चलनिकाल दिया अब अब ये निकली हुई चीजों कोक्या करेंगे मैंने कहा रुको अभी रुको पहलेनिकालते जाते हैं पहले निकालते जाते हैंसर हमने पीसीटी से निकाल दिया हां सरनिकाल दिया अब किससे निकालेंगे सर नले लूपसे नले पाश नले पाश नले लूप से निकालेंगेअब नले लूप की यह वाली कौन सी भुजा है सरये अवरोही है और यह कौन सी है आरोहीहै ठीक है अगर ये याद ना रहे अवरोही आरोहीबहुत सिंपल सा आपने एक मूवी देखी होगीआशिकी आई थी क्योंकि तुम ही हो तुम ही होमेरी जिंदगी तुम ही हो बस तुम ही हो तुमही हो याद आ रहा है ना गाना हा सर याद आरहा है है ना उस मूवी में जो हीरोइन थीश्रद्धा कपूर उसका मूवी में नाम क्या

रहा है और यहां सेतरल ऊपर जा रहा है तो यहां पर ऊपर जा रहाहै जिंदगी में ऊपर जा रहा है जिंदगी मेंनीचे जा रहा है है अब जरा सोच कौन सीआरोही कौन सी अवरोही सर यह हैआरोही ठीक है और यह क्या कहलाए गीअवरोही ठीक अब याद रह जाएगा ठीक है अबदेखिए ये जो आरोही भुजा है इधर देखना 125एमएल छन रहा है 125 एमएल प्रति मिनट छनाछना उसमें से केवल1.25 एमएल यहां पर पहुंचा प्रति मिनट हांपहुंचा यानी 1 पर पहुंचा 999 पर कहां थाउस 99999 पर में से 70 से 80 पर हमने यहांसे निकाल लिबाहर क्या-क्या निकाल लिया ये मैंने आपकोबता दिया है अब इसके बाद जो भी चीज नहींनिकली है जिसको हमने निषद बोलते हैं क्याबोलते हैं नि सद जो चीज छनी थी यहां परक्या कहलाती है निस यानी जो चीज छन रही हैउसको हम क्या बोल रहे हैं फिल्ट्रेट नी सदउसमें से मैक्सिमम चीजें यहां पर बाहरनिकाली गई है ठीक है अब वो निषद जब यहांपर आएगा किसमें अवरोही भुजा तो इस अवरोहीभुजा मेंसे क्या निकाल लिया जाएगा बेटा जलक्या निकाल लिया जाएगा जल यानी यह वालीभुजा केवल जल के लिए पारगम्य है याद रखनाकेवल और केवल किसके लिए पारगम्य जल के लिएपारगम्य है किसी भी लवण के लिए पारगम्यनहीं है अब थोड़ा सा कॉमन सेंस लगाए एकलिक्विड आ रहा है यहां पर उस लिक्विड मेंसे उस निषद में से अगर तुम जल जल जलनिकालते जाओगे तो वो जो लिक्विड जो नीचेपहुंचेगा वो कैसा हो जाएगा जरा सोचिए एकतरल में से अगर तुम जल निकालते जाओगे तोकैसा हो जाएगा तनु के सांद्र सांद्र ना तोये जो ये जो मटेरियल जो आया यहां पर उसमेंसे मैक्सिमम चीजों को आपने यहां से निकाललिया ओके सर अब वो चीज जब नीचे आएगी तोउसमें से आपने जल निकाल लिया ओके सर तो वोजो पदार्थ क्या कहला रहा है निस यहां परकैसा हो जाएगा सर यहां पर सांद्र हो जाएगातो हेले लूकी अवरोही भुजा जो होतीहै अवरोही भुजा होती है वह जल के लिएपारगम्य होतीहै और जल के लिए अगर पारगम्य होएगी तो नीसनिस का मतलब जो चीज छन रही है निस कैसा होजाएगा सांद्र होजाएगा कैसा हो जाएगा नि सेंद्र यहां परपहुंचते पहुंचते कैसा हो जाएगा सांद्रक्योंकि उसमें से क्या निकलता जाएगा पानीनिकलता जाएगा ओके सर अब जरा सोचिए यहसांद्र कंसंट्रेटेड सांद्र निस जब ऊपरजाएगा ऊपर जाते जाते इसमें से अब आरोहीभुजा जो होती है वो जल के लिए पारगम्यनहीं होती है वो लवण के लिए पारगम्य जैसेदेखिए सारा जल नहीं निकाला अभी आप ये सोचसर सारा जल निकाल लिया बेटा अगर सारा जलनिकाल लेंगे तो मूत्र कैसे बनेगा है ना तोहमने यहां पर जल निकाला है लेकिन सारानहीं निकाला ठीक है अब यहां से जब ये ऊपरजाएगा अब जरा सोचिए ये अभी भी तरल ही हैउसमें से हमने कुछ जल निकाल लिया यह तरलजब ऊपर जाएगा उसमें से अगर आप लवण निकाललोगे लवण निकाल लोगे तो कैसा हो जाएगायहां पर नीस कैसा हो जाएगा जरा सोचिए तनुनहीं हो जाएगा डाइल्यूट नहीं हो जाएगा तोयाद रखना बेटा जी आपकीजो आपकी जोअ कैसा हो जाता है ये देखो ये लिखा हुआ हैतनु हो जाएगा याद रखना तो कुल मिलाकरआरोही भुजा जो होती है आरोही भुजा जो होतीहै वो किसके लिए पारगम्य होती है बेटालवणों के लिए पारगम्य होती है याद रखनाकिसके लिए वैद्युत अपघटक लिए लवणों के लिएक्या होती है पारगम्य होती है ठीक है ठीकहै सर किसके लिए द्युत अपघटन देताहूं या सिंपलएएल इसके लिए पारगम्य होती है क्या होतीहै इनके लिए पारगम्य होती है और इनके लिएअगर पारगम्य होती है तोनिषद कैसा हो जाएगा वह लिक्विड जो जा रहाहै घूम रहा है वह कैसा हो जाएगातनअगर आपने पहले यह चीज 11वीं में नहीं पढ़ीतो आराम से समझ में आ रही है मेरे ख्यालसे अगर ध्यान से सुनेंगे तो सीधी सधी बातसमझ में आएगी मेरे भाई देख वापस से सुनमैंने कहा रक्त आया हां सर आया रक्त मेंक्या है अच्छे पदार्थ भी और बुरे पदार्थभी है इस गुच्छ से नीचे छना कौन प्लाज्माविदाउट प्रोटीन कितना 125 एमएल प्रति मिनटओके जिसको हमने जीएफआर बोल दिया जो चीजछनती है उसको हमने क्या बोला नीस छनछने के बाद 125 एमएल में से यह 125 एएलघूमते घूमते घूमते जब यहां पहुंचा तोकितना रह गया यहां पर केवल 1.25 एए वोक्या है मूत्र है प्रति मिनट तो बाकी 99पर कहां गया तो हमने सारे के सारे 999 परमें से मैक्सिमम को तो हमने पीसीटी सेबाहर निकाल लिया क्या निकाला मैंने बतादिया फिर वो जो चीज जो नीस जो फिल्ट जोयहां से निकल गया था मतलब यहां से जो निकलगया है अब वो जब आएगा तो उसमें से जलनिकाल दिया जल निकाल दिया तो निस कैसा होजाएगा सांद्र हो जाएगा फिर ऊपर जाते हुएउसमें से क्या निकाल दिया वैद्युत अपटनिकाल दिया सोडियम पोटेशियम क्लोरीन येसारे निकाल दिए तो कैसा हो जाएगा तनु होजाएगा ठीक है जी यहां तक की बात समझ में आगई हो अब इसके बाद बारी आ रही किसकी डीटीकी देखि डी सटी से डीटी जो होती है येनॉर्मली नॉर्मल तरीके से अगर मैं देखूं तोइससे ज्यादा कुछ निकलता नहीं है लेकिन हांजब हमारे शरीर में रक्त का आयतन कम होजाता है हमारे शरीर में मूत्र ज्यादाउत्सर्जित होता है शरीर से जल निकलता जाताहै तब यह काम करता है तब यहां पर यानीविशेष परिस्थितियों में काम करेगी क्याडीसीटीसी से अवशोषण तो होएगाडीसीटीएम आयन और क्या निकाला जाएगा जलनिकाला जाएगा लेकिन कब निकाला जाता हैविशेष परिस्थितियों मेंविशेष परिस्थितिमें विशेष परिस्थिति मेंसोडियम और जल का क्या होता है बेटा जी यादरखना अवशोषण विशेष परिस्थिति में सोडियमआयन और जल निकाला जाताहै यह आपने जल निकाल दिया यह सोडियम आयननिकाल दिया ओके अब साहब यहां पर पहुंचासंग्रह नलिका में संग्रह नलिका में मूत्रपहुंचा और इस मूत्र में उत्सर्जी पदार्थकौन यूरिया है ना है ना कौन है मेरे भाईयूरिया है ना सर इससे भी निकाला जाएगा कुछमैंने कहा हां इससे भी निकाला सर यहां सेक्या निकालते हो यहां से यूरिया निकालतेहैं सर यूरिया क्यों

तो हमने यहांपर यूरिया निकाल दिया अब क्यों निकाला आइएदेखते हैं समझते हैं चलिए यहां तक की बातसमझ में आ गई कोई कंफ्यूजन नहीं है तो यहसारी चीजें जो है यहां पर लिखी हुई हैसंग्रह नलिका से क्या निकालते हैं डी सटीसे क्या निकालते हैं ले लूप की अवरोहीआरोही से क्या निकालते समीप से क्यानिकालते ठीक है अब सर कंफ्यूजन हमारेदिमाग में बस इतना स ही है यह यूरियाक्योंनिकाला यहए निकाल दिया था आपने ठीक है अच्छी बात हैयूजफुल है यह विशेष परिस्थितियों में यहांसे कब निकलेगा और यहां से आपने जल निकाल रहै ठीक है ये चीज समझ में आ गई है अबप्रश्न आता है यहां पर इसके बाद में ये तोचीज क्लियर है यही चीज यहां पर देखो येदेखो यूरिया लिखा हुआ हैनिकाल मैक्सिमम चीजें यहां से बाहर निकालली जाती है ठीक है चलिए अब इंपॉर्टेंट चीजहै यहां पर जो टॉपिक जो बहुत कंफ्यूज करताहै वोह है ये निस निषद का मतलब जो चीजछानी है को सांद्रण करने की

की कोशिश कर रहा हूंदेखते कितने बच्चे पकड़ पाते हैं देख मेरेभाई इस हेले लूप में यहां से पदार्थ यहांजा रहा था नीचे जा रहा था और इस वाली सेऊपर आ रहा था है ना ठीक हैये हमारी ले लूप है काली वाली इसमेंपदार्थ यहां से यहां जा रहा था और यहां सेऊपर जा रहा ओके ओके यहां नीचे और यहां सेऊपर यह कौनहै नलेलू और यह कौन है सर वासरेक्ट कौन है यह वासरे अब वास रेक्ट कोजरा देखना यहां पर पीछे इधर देखना यह तोहमारी ए लूप हो गई अब वासरे जरा देखनावासरे क्या थी मेरेभाई वास रेक्ट क्या थी इधर देखिएगा यह वासरेटा परि नल की केशिका तो थी क्या थी यहदेख ये येये यहांसे फिर यहांजाएगी कहा सर जी माथा हिल गया माथा हिलेगादेख यह वासयहां से आ रही है और यहां जा रही है यहांसे यहां जा रही यहां से यहां जा रही हैयानी वासरे क्टा में जो भी पदार्थ आएगा वहयहां से आएगा और यहां जाएगा अब आप मुझेबताएंगे नले लूप में इधर आ रहा है इधर जारहा है वास रेक्ट में इधर से आ रहा है इधरजा रहा है क्या दोनों अपोजिट डायरेक्शनमें जाएंगे कि नहीं जाएंगे जाएंगे है नायह नीचे यह ऊपर यह ऊपर यह नीचे यह प्रतिधारा कहलाए गी कि नहीं कहलाए कीी यानी जोधाराए हैं जो भी तरल जो है जिस धारा मेंबह रहे हैं यह एक दूसरे के अपोजिट है यानहीं है है ना हा सर है ठीक है अब इधरदेखना बाहर आपने क्या निकाल दिया था सरबाहर हमने ए निकाला था और यहां पर यहां सेतो बाहर निकाला था और संग्रह नलिका जोयहां पर थी हमारी उस संग्रह नलिका से हमनेयूरिया निकाला था यह संग्रह नलिका है यहवास रेक्ट की अवरोही भुजा है और यह आरोहीहै यानी दोनों एक दूसरे के अपोजिट होतेहैं ठीक है अब सर येकरेंगे भैया सर जी यहां से हमने जल निकालदिया कैसे निकाल दिया मैंने आपको बता दियाकि जब आपने ए और यूरिया यहां पर निकाल दिएथे तो परासरण बढ़ गई है और मोलेरिटी बढ़गई है विद्युत अपघटन वण बढ़ गए हैं लवणबढ़ गए हैं तो यह जो अवरोही भुजा थी यहांसे जल निकल आएगा अब क्या करेंगे कुछ नहींजल को यहां डाल देंगे खत्म इस जल को इसमेंडाल देंगे इस ए को इसमें डालदेंगे और और और इधर देख इधर देख ध्यान सेदेख ये जो यूरिया जो है यह जो यूरिया जोहै इसको वापस से इसके अंदर डाल देंगे माथाहिल गया ए निकाला निकाल कर इसमें डाल दियाजल निकाला जल निकाल कर इसमें डाल दिया हैना और यूरिया को वापस इसमें डाल दिया अबक्या होएगा इधर देख ध्यान रखना किसको कहांनिकाला था यूरिया निकालकर वापस से यहांडाल दिया यहांठीक हैजा रहे हैं फिर यह वास रेक्ट जाकर नीचे एकशिरा में खुलती है तो जरा सोचिए सारी कीसारी चीजों को आपने क्या कर लिया है पहलेअवशोषित किया फिर वापस अवशोषित करके परिनली के केशिका या वास रेक्ट में डाल दियाइसीलिए इस प्रक्रिया को हम क्याबोलेंगेपुनर अवशोषण इसलिए मैंने थोड़ी सी जगहखाली रखी थी पुनरा अवशोषण बोलेंगे किपुनरा अवशोषण का मतलब कि पहले अब्जॉर्बकरके बाहर निकाला बाहर निकाल के वापसअब्जॉर्ब करा किसके अंदर इस वास रेक्ट औरयह परि नलकीय केशिका में डाल दिया दिस इजकॉल्ड पुनरा अवशोषण और यूरिया जो बाहरनिकाला था वो वापस यहां डाल दिया अब येयूरिया फिर से घूमते यहां जाएगा ओके नोप्रॉब्लम यानी देखो जो भी यूरिया यहां परआ रहा है उसमें से कुछ निकालते हैं देखोपूरी ओवरऑल कहानी मैं आपको बताता हूं देखोछाना ठीक है अब ध्यान से सुनना जिसको अभीतक समझ में नहीं आया ध्यान से सुनना मैंनेय प्लाज्मा छानी विदाउट प्रोटीन 125 एमएलप्रति मिनट जिसमें यूजफुल पदार्थ भी है औरहार्मफुल भी है यह छानकर जब मैं पीसीटीमें आया तो मैक्सिमम चीजों को मैंने बाहरनिकाल लिया जो यूजफुल चीजें हैं वो बाहर आगई है ठीक है आ गई है जो हार्मफुल है वोबाहर नहीं आ रही है क्यों क्योंकि उनकोबाहर निकलने नहीं दे रही है यहां कीकोशिकाएं सिलेक्टिव है चयन कर रही है केवलजो उपयोगी चीजें उनको बाहर निकाल दिया ठीकहै पीसीटी से बाहर आ गई अब शोषण हो गयासिमिलरली नले लूप की नीचे वाली भुजा से जलनिकलेगा कैसे निकल जाएगा जल जल तभी लेगाजब मध्यांचलका बढ़ी हुई होगी परासरण कैसे बढ़ गई येजो यहां सेये बदली है परि नलिके केशिका वो केशिका कावो भाग जो हेले लूप के चारों तरफ है क्याकहला रहा है वास रेक्ट हमने ये सारी चीजेंनिकाल कर इस परि नलिक केशिका के अंदर डालदी खत्म खल्लास बस ये क्या कहला रहा हैपुनरा अवशोषण कहला रहा है मेरे भाई यूरियाको हमने वापस से यहां डाल दिया ये घूम करयहां आ जाए यानी मान लो 100 अणु है यूरियाके जिसमें से 20 अणु बाहर निकलते हैंपरासरण का बढ़ाते हैं जल अवशोषित हो जाताहै फिर वापस अंदर डाल दिए जाते हैं फिरवापस चले जाते हैं फिर वापस से जब मूत्रबनेगा तो यूरिया निकाल लिया जाएगा यूरियानिकालने के बाद परासरण का बढ़ जाएगी जलबाहर आ जाएगा इस तरीके से मूत्र क्या होताजाएगा सांद्र होता जाएगा ये है बेटा जीयहां पर पूरी कहानी कुल मिलाकर सांद्रताकरने की ये थीप्रतिधानी सी बात है य ठीक है नेक्स्ट अबइसके बाद अगला जो टॉपिक आता है वो है वृकक्रियाओं का नियमन अब सर ये क्या है अब दोचीजें हैं इनको हमें समझना है वृकक्रियाओं का नियमन देखिए इसको समझने केलिए सबसे पहली चीज मैंने बोला मेरेअंदर जल कम होता जा रहाहै मेरे अंदर क्या कम होता जा रहा है जलकम होता जा रहा है या तो मेरे को लूज मोशनलग गए हैं आप जानते हैं ना दस्त लग गए हैंदस्त में क्या होता है पानी निकल जाता हैना लूज मोशन लग गए हैं या पसीना बहुत आरहा है गर्माहट है तो मेरे अंदर जल कीक्या हो रही है कमी हो रही है अब ध्यान सेसुनना रक्त जो होता है ना रक्त उसका लगभगलगभग रक्त का लगभग लगभग 70 टू 80 परपोर्शन जो होता है वो जल बनाता है क्याबोला मैंने हमारा जो ब्लड होता है ना ब्लडउस ब्लड में प्लाज्मा है ना प्लाज्मा तरलहै ना कैसे हो गया तरल उसमें जल ही तोहोगा है ना सो यह जो जल जो होता है अगर कमहो रहा है सोच अगर मेरे शरीर में जल कम होरहा है तो मेरे रक्त काआयतन बढ़ रहा है कि कम हो रहा है सर कम होरहा है कॉमन सेंस बहुत सिंपल सा कॉमन सेंसक्या मैंने बो मेरे अंदर जल की कमी हो रहीहै भाई कैसे हो रही है बता दिया आपको यातो दस्त उल्टी खांसी लग गए हैं या पसीनाबहुत निकल रहा है ठीक है अगर जल कम होताजाएगा तो जल क्या बनाता है रक्त कानिर्माण करता है रक्त में जल ही तो होताहै ना जल अगर कम हो जाएगा तो रक्त कावॉल्यूम जो है आयतन जो है वो भी कम होजाएगा अब जरा सोच अगर रक्त का आयतन कम होगया रक्त का वॉल्यूम कम हो गया रक्त कम हैतो उसका दाब भी तो कम हो जाएगा ना रक्त काआयतन अगर कम है तो रक्त का दाब भी तो क्याहो जाएगा कम होजाएगा भाई जरा सोच भरपूर मात्रा में रक्तहै दबा दबा के दाब लगा रहा है व्यक्तियोंपर किसकी रक्त नलिका की रक्त अगर कम होजाएगा तो उसका दाब भी कम हो जाएगा ठीक हैसर रक्त का आयतन कम हो जाएगा रक्त का दाबकम हो जाएगा ठीक है अब इस परिस्थिति मेंआपके हिसाब से हमें क्या करना चाहिए क्याकरना चाहिए सर हमें ना हमें ना क्या करनाचाहिए एक काम हम कर सकते हैं क्या रक्तके दाबको बढ़ास रक्त के दाब को बढ़ा सकतेहैं अगर रक्त का दाब अगर बढ़ गया रक्त कादाब अगर बढ़ गया तो अच्छी बात है और क्याकर सकते हैं सर कहीं ना कहीं मूत्र जोनिकल रहा था जो वैसे ही सांद्र था उसमेंसे हम जल निकाल रहे थे और जल अगर निकालनेतो वैसे तो हम जल निकाल ही रहे थे प्रभुवैसे तो हम यहां से जल निकाल ही रहे थेसोचिए हम यहां से वैसे तो जल निकाल ही रहेथे जल तो हम निकाल ही रहे थे यहां से अगरऔर जल निकाल ले तो बहुत ही ज्यादा क्या होजाएगा मूत्र सांद्र हो जाएगा यही तो करनाहै मेरे भाई हमें जल की जो हानि हो रही हैउसको कम करना है मेरे अंदर जल कम होता जारहा है तो आप मुझे बताएं मेरे मूत्र का 95पर भाग जल होता है मेरे यूरीन का आपकेयूरिन का 95 पर भाग जल होता है अगर इसमूत्र में से जल निकाल लू निकाल लू तोऑटोमेटिक सी बात है जल की हानि थोड़ी सीकम नहीं हो जाएगी हो जाएगी ना तो हमेंक्या करना चाहिए आपके हिसाब से सर हमें नाएक तो रक्त के दाब को बढ़ानाचाहिए रक्त के दाब को हमें क्या करनाचाहिए बढ़ाना चाहिए और जो जल जो हैउसको मूत्र में से खींच लेना चाहिए सरकैसे करेंगे कैसे करेंगे तो यहां पर ध्यानसे सुनना ये करने के लिए ये करने के लिएकौन काम करने वाला है ध्यान सेसुनना सबसे पहलास्टेप यह जो हो रहा है यह सारी चीजें जोहो रही है इनको सही किया जाता है दोतरीकों से पहला तरीका क्या है ध्यान सेसुनना मेरी बात को प्रभु ध्यान से सुननामैंने बोला मेरे अंदर जल की कमी ओके सरमेरा रक्त का आयतन कम ओके सर मेरे रक्त कादाब कम ओके सर मुझे क्या करना है मेरेशरीर में कहीं ना कहीं रख के दाब कोबढ़ाना है हां जी जल की जो कमी हो रही हैउसको और नहीं बढ़ाना है जल को निकलने सेरोकना है कैसे करेंगे सर यह सारा काम कैसेकरेंगे तो सबसे पहले ध्यान से सुनना इसपरिस्थिति में हमारे मस्तिष्क का एक भागहोता है जिसका नाम होता हैहाइपोथैलेमसहाइपोथैलेमस ठीक है क्या होता हैहाइपोथैलेमस होता है और इस हाइपोथैलेमसहालांकि आप पढ़ेंगे बाद में इसहाइपोथैलेमस से जुड़ी होती है एक ग्रंथिजिसका नाम होता है पीयूष ग्रंथि इस पीयूषग्रंथि का यह भाग होता हैअग्र और यह होता हैपश्च और इस पश्च भाग से दो हार्मोन निकलतेहैं एक होता है एडीए जिसका दूसरा नाम होताहैवसोप और एक होता है ऑक्सीटोसिनये दो हार्मोन होते है एक होता है एडीएजिसका दूसरा नामवेसोप्रोसिन प्रभु ये दोनों हार्मोन जो हैना यह बनते यहां परहै इन दोनों हार्मोन का निर्माण जोहै निर्माण जो है वो यहां पर होता है कहांपर हाइपोथैलेमस यहां पर बनते हैं लेकिनयहां से निकल नहीं पाते तो निकलने के लिएजो रास्ता है वो यहां से किससे पश्च प्यूषग्रंथि से तो मैंने सिंपल बोलाहाइपोथैलेमस में हार्मोन बन रहे हैं यहदोनों बनते यहां पर है लेकिन निकलते कहांसे पश्च प्यूज ग्रंथि से क्योंकि रास्तानहीं होता निकलने का तो यहां से निकलतेओके सर अब मैंने बोला मेरे शरीर में यहकंडीशन है मुझे यह करना है एक तो रक्त केदाब को बढ़ाना और जल की हानि को कम करनाहै जलकी हानि जो हो रहीहै उसको कम करनाहै कैसे करूंगा तो इस परिस्थिति में दरकॉमन सेंस लगाना ध्यान से सुनना इसपरिस्थिति में हाइपोथैलेमस के अंदर ये जोदो हार्मोन ये दोनों इनमें से पर्टिकुलरमैं बात कर रहा हूंइसकी एच की ऑक्सीटोसिन से मेरा यहां परकोई लेना देना नहीं है मैं किसकी बात कररहा हूं एडी जिसका दूसरा नाम है वेसोप्रेसन इसकी मैं बात करने वालाहूं इससे कोई लेना देना नहीं ऑक्सीटोसिनहमारा मेन काम है ए सर य एडी क्या करेगाबेटा येएडीए जाकर इधर ध्यान से सुनना ये एडीयावसोप दो कामकरेंगे क्या काम करेंगे ध्यान से देखनाएडीजाकर यहांसे जल निकलवादेगा कहां से निकाला डीसीडी से याद करिमैंने क्या बोला था विशेष परिस्थितियोंमें निकलता है क्या निकाल दिया सर क्यानिकाल दिया सर जल निकाला कहां से डी सटीसे अगर जरा सोच यहां से जल ही जल निकालतेजाएंगे तो यहां पर मूत्र और ज्यादा सांद्रहो जाएगा देखो यहां से तो जल निकल ही रहाहै यहां से भी अगर निकाल देंगे तो मूत्रऔर ज्यादा सांद्र नहीं हो जाएगा हमें यहीतो करना था अरे भैया जल की हानि को रोकनाही तो था ऑलरेडी जल कम है तो क्या जलनिकाल देंगे क्या नहीं ना जल को निकलने सेबचाएंगे यहां से खींच लेंगे भाई यहां सेतो खींच ही रहे हैं सामान्य रूप से यहांसे भी खींच लिया विशेष परिस्थितियों मेंकिसने खींचा हार्मोन ने क्या नाम है एडीएतो एडी ने जाकर इस एडी एच ने जाकर जलकापुनरा अवशोषण करादिया कहां से करा दिया बेटा डीसी ठीक है अब आप बोलेंगे सर यह सारी चीजतो ठीक है समझ में आया सर आपने एडी की फुलफॉर्म नहीं बताई अब बताऊंगा नाएंटी डाई यूरेटएंटी डाईयूरेटहार्मोन क्या बोलते हैं एंटी डाई यूरेटहार्मोन सर क्या मीनिंग है ध्यान से सुननामैं बोल रहाअत्याधिकअत्याधिक मूत्रको अत्याधिक मूत्र को बोला जाता हैडाइरसडाई यूरेस ज्यादा से ज्यादा मूत्र निकालनेकी प्रक्रिया को बोला जाता हैडास एंटी डरेस हार्मोन का मतलब यानी जोअत्यधिक मूत्र को निकालने से रोकेगा यानीजो मूत्र को मूत्र को निकालने से रोकेगाभाई यही तो कराना था अरे यही तो कराना थाहमें यहां से मूत्र को निकालने से रोकनाहै या मूत्र में जो जल आ रहा है उसकोनिकालने से रोकना है डा यूरेस से बचाना हैअत्यधिक त्रण से बचाना है कैसे बचाएंगे यहहार्मोन यहां से उल्टा काम कर रहा है एंटीडरेस कर रहा है अत्यधिक मूत्र के खिलाफकार्य कर रहा है मूत्र जो हो रहा थाजिसमें मूत्र में जल बन जल था उसके खिलाफकाम कर रहा कैसे जल का अवशोषण करा दियाखत्म खल्लास इतनी सी बात है तो एएच का येकार्य हो गया क्या क्या बेटा जी जल कापुनर अवशोषण कहां से डीसीडी से विशेषपरिस्थिति हो गई हां सर ये लो जी हमें जलकी कि हानि को रोकना था रोक लिया जल कोअवशोषित करा लिया ओके अब दूसरा ये तो एडीएका काम हो गया अब एडीए को हमने दूसरा नामदिया वेसप्रोको दो नाम क्यों क्योंकि वो दो कार्य कररहा है एक तो ये कर दिया डा यूरेसिल सेडाई यूरेस से बचा दिया इसलिए हमने इसकोएंटी एंटी मतलब अगेंस्ट विपरीत काम कियाअत्यधिक मत्र के विपरीत काम किया जल कोअवशोषित करला ठीक है अब इसी हार्मोन कोदूसरा नाम लिखा है वसोप जरा कॉमन सेंसलगाओ वेसो वर्ड किससे आया अंग्रेजी कावर्ड है वेसो किससे वेसल्स वेसल्स क्याहोती है नलिका है ना और प्रेसन का मतलबहोता है प्रेस करना अब मैं आपसे एक सिंपलसा प्रश्न पूछता हूं आप सबके घर में कहींना कहीं आप सभी ने नली से पानी दिया हैपानी हा सर पानी दिया सोच एक नलीहै और इस नली के आगे यह छेद है और यह गमलाहै इस गमले में पेड़ है आप इसमें पानी देरहे हैं और यह पानी यहां पर गिर रहा हैठीकहै ओके ओके सर अब मैंने क्या किया इस नलीके छेद केआगे अपना हाथ लगा दिया उंगली लगा दी आपलोगों ने कि यह नली है नली से पानी निकलरहा है यह पानी यहां से यहां तक आ रहा थाआपने इसके आगे उंगली लगा दी अब ये प्रेशरसे आगे तक जाएगा कि नहीं जाएगा उंगलीलगाने के क्या हो जाएगा सर आपने उंगली लगादी इसको उंगली कर दी इसको है तो क्या होजाएगा पानी दूर तक जाएगा कि नहीं जाएगाहां सर जाएगाज्यादा प्रेशर से जाएगा कि नहीं जाएगा हाजाएगा अब इस चीज से आप क्या समझे सोचिएबहुत सिंपल सी बात इस चीज से आप क्या समझेकि भाई साहब यह एक रक्त नलिकाहै यह रक्त नलिका के अंदर रक्त था जो दाबलगा रहाथा रक्त का वॉल्यूम कम था तो दाब भी कम थाअब इमेजिन कर अगर इस रक्त नलिका को मैंछोटा कर दू पतला कर दू तो य यहां पर जो येथोड़ा बहुत रखते है जब ये पतली सी नलिकामें जाएगा तो दाब बढ़ जाएगा कि कम होजाएगा बढ़ जाएगा ना सेम टू सेम ये पानी कीनलिका थी इसकी पानी की नलिका को अगर आपछोटा कर दें तो दाब नहीं बढ़ जाएगा प्रेशरसे पानी नहीं निकलेगा बस वही चीज है तोजरा सोचिए प्रेस कर दिया इस रक्त नलिका कोप्रेस कर दिया और नलिका को क्या बोलते हैंवेसल तो मेरे भाई ये जो वेसो प्रेसन जोहोता है ये क्या करता है ये रक्त नलिका कोप्रेस कर देता है छोटा कर देता है उसकेआयतन को छोटा कर देता है अब जरा सोचिएब्लड वेसल को ब्लड वेसल यानी रक्त नलिकाको क्या कर देता है कंटक्ट संकुचित करदेताहै अब इमेजिन करिए रक्त नलिका अगर संकुचितहो जाएगी रक्त नलिका अगर संकुचित हो जाएगीतो रक्त का दाब बढ़ नहीं जाएगा क्या बढ़जाएगा ना लो जी दोनों काम हो गए यही तोदोनों कराने थे रक्त दाब को बढ़ाना था औरजल की हानि को कम करना था ये लो जी हो गयाहमारा काम किससे एक हार्मोन से जिसका नामहै एडीए या दूसरा नाम है वसोप एक हीहार्मोन दोनों कार्य कर रहा है ओके सर यहतो हो गया हमारे पास पहला तरीका एक औरतरीका होता है सर दूसरा तरीका कौन सा होताहै ध्यान से सुनना दूसरा तरीका होता हैजिसको हम बोलते हैंरास रास लीला नहीं बोलेंगे रास बोलते हैंसिर्फ रासअब सर यह रास क्या है फुल फॉर्म हैरेनिनएंजियोटेंसएल्डोरसिस्टम सर इंग्लिश में लिख दिया हिंदी मेंभी यही बोलते हैं रेनिन को रेनिन बोलतेएंटेंस को एंटेंस एल्डोर को एल्डोस्टलसिस्टम को तंत्र बोलते हैंबस तो रेनिन एंजियोटेंसिनोजेनय अब इमेजिन करो यहां से क्या आ रहाहै रक्त आ रहा हैसर आ रहा है सोच मैंने कंडीशन क्या बोलीहै मैंने कहा कि भैया मेरे अंदर यह कंडीशनहो रही है मुझे तो यह करनाहै रक्त के दाब को बढ़ाना है जल की हानिको रोकना एक तरीका तो यह था और क्या तरीकामैंने कहा कि यह कंडीशन मेरे अंदर हो रहीहै यानी रक्त का दाब क्या हो रहा है कम होरहा है जरा सोच यहां से जो रक्त आ रहा थारक्त अगर आ रहा है उसका आयतन अगर कम हैउसका दाब अगर कम है तो जो नीचे चीज छने गीवो ज्यादा छने गी कि कम छने गी कम छने गीजीएफआर क्या होजाएगा कम हो जाएगा यह तो देखो कॉमन सेंसकी बात है इसको तो फील करना पड़ेगा अगर आपफील नहीं कर पाएंगे तो सब ऊपर से जाएगासोच यहां से क्या आ रहा है रक्त आ रहा हैरक्त में प्लाज्मा नीचे क्या हो रही है छनरही है अब जरा सोच रक्त ही अगर कम आ रहाहै सर क क्यों आ रहा है अरे मेरे भाई रक्तका आयतन कम हो गया क्यों कम हो गया अरे जलकम हो गया शरीर में जल ही तो क्या बना रहाथा रक्त बना रहा था तो मैंने बोला कि भाईयहां से रक्त कम आ रहा है तो रक्त का दाबकम है दाब कम है तो नीचे छने का भी कम छनेका कम यानी जीएफआर क्या हो गया कम हो गयाजीएफ आर अगर कम हो गया तो यहां से जोपदार्थ जो जाएंगे वो कम कम कम कम जाएंगेकम कम कम कम जा रहे हैं जब ये कम कमजाएंगे तो ये जो डी सटी

झिल्ली जोहोतीहै ये डीसीटीटी झिल्ली थी इस झिल्ली मेंमिल रही थी कौन ये कोशिका कौन सी जेजी सेओके सर अब इधर देखना मैंने बोला रक्त आरहा है हां आ रहा है कैसा आ रहा है कम आरहा है क्यों कम आ रहा है क्योंकि रक्त काआयतन कम है क्यों कम है क्योंकि शरीर मेंजल कम है तो रक्त का आयतन कैसा आ रहा हैकम रक्त का दाब क्या हो गया कम कम होजाएगा तो नीचे छने का कम जीएफआर क्या होजाएगा कम निषद क्या बनेगा कम ये निषद जबयहां

संकुचित होजाएंगी तो दिमाग लगाओ रक्त दाब नहीं बढ़जाएगा रक्त दाब बढ़ जाएगा सर यही तो करानाथा यही तो कराना था रक्त दाब को बढ़ाना थाऔर जल की हानि को कम करना था यहां पर हमनेदेखा था ये पहला तरीका था यहां पर हमनेदेखा था कि ये दोनों काम एक ही हार्मोन कररहा है वो ब्लड वेसल को रक्त नलिका कोसंकुचित भी कर रहा है और जल को खींच भीरहा था कहां सेएडीए के रूप में है ना अब हमने दूसरातरीका देखा दूसरे तरीके में क्या था साहबयहां से जैसे ही जीएफआर कम हो गया था रक्तकम आ रहा था निषद कम आ रहा था तो जेजी सेलसे रेनिन निकला रेनिन ने एंजियोटेंसिनोजेनको एंजियोटेंसिनोजेनसेकंड क्या कर रहा है दो काम कर रहा हैजिसमें से एक काम तो इसने कर दिया रक्तदाब बढ़ा दिया चलो हमारा एक मकसद तो पूराहो गया क्या बढ़ाना था रक्त दाब दूसराक्या क था दूसरा क्या था जल को खींचना थाखींचना था अभ इधर देख ये एंजियोटेंसिनोजेनदो भाग होते हैं एक होता है

इसमें है ना और हल्का पीला होताहै पीला किसके कारण होता हैय हमारीएनसीआरटी बोल नहीं रही है वर्णक होतेजिनका नाम होता है यूरोक्रोमयूरोक्रोम वर्णक होते हैं इन वर्ण कों केकारण पीला रंग आता है किसका मूत्र काजिसमें लगभग 25 से 30 ग्राम क्या होता हैयूरिया होता है सिंपल इतनी सी बात थी ठीकहै अब यहां तक की बात अगर आपको समझ में आगई है तो यहां से यहां तक की जो बातेंलिखी हुई है उसमें यह लिखा हुआ है कि देखोहमारी किडनी ने मूत्र बनाया ठीक है बनाकरकिस में डाल दिया मूत्र नलिका मूत्र नलिकाले जाकर किसम डाल दिया मूत्राशय अबमूत्राशय में इकट्ठा हुआ पड़ा है भरता जारहा है भरता जा रहा है भरता जा रहा हैबढ़ता जा रहा है मुत आशय फैलता जा रहा हैफैलता जा रहा है फैलता जा रहा इतना फैलगया कि अब जब फैलने की क्षमता नहीं बचेगीनहीं बचेगी तो वहां से एक सिग्नल जाएगाहमारे तंत्रिका तंत्र में गया कि भैया औरनहीं फैल सकता मैं मूत्राशय ने बोला औरनहीं फैल सकता जितना भरना था भर गया मूत्रअब और नहीं फैल सकता हूं एक सिग्नल भेजाकिसके पास हमारे ब्रेन के पास ब्रेन केपास जब सिग्नल आया तो उसका विश्लेषण कियागया क्या अरे बाबू यह तो फट जाएगा जल्दीसे क्या करो खोलो जो मूत्राशय जो है उसकेनीचे अवरोध है अवरोध का मतलब कहीं ना कहींकपाट है एक तरीके से इस कपाटको यह जो कपाट जो है खोल दो इसको खुलजाएगा मत्र नीचे मूत्राशय मूत्र मार्ग सेहोता हुआ बाहर निकल जाएगा बस इतनी सी बातबता रखी खत्म तो यह बात बता रखी है किकैसे मूत्र का उत्सर्जन होता है यह बतारखा है मूत्र में क्या मिलता है ये सारीचीजें हैं अब लास्ट में एक सिंपल सी चीजबता रखी है मेरे भाई एक बीमारी होती हैजिसका नाम होता है डायबिटीज मेलिटस क्याहोती है डायबिटीज मेलिटस है ना जिसमेंक्या होता है इंसुलिन हार्मोन जो होता हैये हालांकि आप बाद में पढ़ेंगे आखिरीचैप्टर में पढ़ेंगे अभी सिर्फ इतना सा बतादेता हूं मेरे अंदर एक हार्मोन है जो मेरेअग्नाशय में बनता है जिसका नाम होता हैइंसुलिन यहां सॉरी यहां अग्नाशय है क्याबनता है इंसुलिन बनता है और इंसुलिन क्याकरता है हमारे रक्त नलिका हों में सेहमारी रक्त नलिका हों में से निकाल करकिसको ग्लूकोज को निकाल कर कोशिकाओं मेंडलवा है ओके अब इमेजिन कर सोच ये मेरीरक्त नलिका इसके अंदर कौन है ये ग्लूकोजहै और इसको निकलवा करर कोशिकाओं मेंडलवाने का काम कौन कर रहा है इंसुलिन हैना तो इंसुलिन मेरे रक्त में से ग्लूकोजको निकालता जा रहा है निकालता जा रहा हैनिकालता जा रहा है तो रक्त में से ग्लूकोजको निकालने का काम रक्त में से ग्लूकोज कोकम करने का काम कोशिकाओं में पहुंचाने काकाम कौन कर रहा है इंसुलिन तो कई बार पूछाजाता है इंसुलिन क्या है रक्त शर्करा केस्तर को क्या करता है कम करता है कैसेरक्त में से शर्करा ही तो है ग्लूकोज कौनहै शर्करा रक्त में से शर्करा के स्तर कोकम करता जा रहा है कैसे निकाल निकाल करकोशिका में डालता जा रहा है सर कोशिका मेंआकर क्या आएगा प्रभू कोशिका में ग्लूकोजजब आएगा तो इसको हम तोड़ेंगे श्वसन होएगाएटीपी बनेगी शवन हो जाएगा तो श्वसन करानेके लिए क्या चाहिए था इंसुलिन चाहिए था अबजरा सोच इंसुलिन कहां बन रहा है हमारेअग्नाशय में बन रहा है अब जब इंसुलिन नहींहोगा इंसुलिन नहीं होगा तो ग्लूकोज नहींजाएगा तो रक्त में क्या भरता जाएगा सरग्लूकोज भरता जाएगा रक्त में ग्लूकोज भरताजाएगा तो हम नहीं बोलते शर्करा कीप्रॉब्लम हो गई है शुगर प्रॉब्लम हो गई हैबोलते हैं ना डायबिटीज हो गई है बोलते हैंना मधुमेह हो गया है बोलते हैं ना तो होताक्या है रक्त में ग्लूकोज भरता जाता है सररक्त में अगर ग्लूकोज भरता जाएगा रक्त तोगाढ़ा हो जाएगा हो जाएगा कि नहीं हो जाएगाभाई आप चीनी मिलाते जाओगे पानी में तोगाढ़ी नहीं हो जाएगी उसी तरीके से रक्तमें अगर ग्लूकोज भरता जाएगा तो रक्त गाढ़ाहो जाएगा और रक्त अगर गाढ़ा हो जाएगा तोहमारी किडनी के पास जब जाएगा तो वो थोड़ाकम छने है ना अब साहब क्या कर रहे इतनासारा ग्लूकोज है क्या सारा का साराग्लूकोज छानना पड़ेगा यस छानो ग नहीं तोकैसे काम चलेगा तो इस परिस्थिति में मूत्रमें ग्लूकोज होगा कि नहीं होएगा भैया इतनासारा ग्लूकोज का का करें इसको निकालेंगेना मूत्र के द्वारा तो मूत्र के द्वारा जबनिकालेंगे तो मूत्र में ग्लूकोज होएगा तोइस परिस्थिति को बोला जाता हैग्लाइकोसुरियाक्या बोलते हैं ग्लाइको सूरिया जिसमेंग्लूकोज उपस्थित होता है किसमें मूत्र मेंसमझ में आ गया क्लियर है हमारे रक्त मेंग्लूकोज था इंसुलिन इसको कोशिकाओं मेंभिजवा है इंसुलिन नहीं होएगा इंसुलिन कबनहीं होता है एक रोग होता है जिसका नामहोता हैडायबिटीज डायबिटीजमेलिटस डायबिटीज मेलिटस बोलते हैंडायबिटीज मेलिटस वो बीमारी है मधुमय वोबीमारी है जिसमें इंसुलिन नहीं बनता है तोग्लूकोज अंदर नहीं जाएगा तो यहां रक्तनलिका में बढ़ता जाएगा बढ़ता जाएगा बढ़ताजाएगा यह रक्त जो है गाढ़ा गाड़ा जब हमारेकिडनी में जाएगा तो ग्लूकोज को हम छाने गेऔर छानकर मूत्र में डाल देंगे और मूत्र केद्वारा हम निकाल देंगे तो ऐसी कंडीशन मेंमूत्र कैसा होता है याद रखना एक बारप्रश्न मैंने देखा था नीट में आया था कौनसी परिस्थिति में मूत्र मीठा होता है हांआपको सुनने में आएगी लेकिन ऐसा प्रश्न आयाथा स्वीट इन टेस्ट स्वीट इन टेस्ट यूरीनकौन सी कंडीशन में होता है कंडीशन क्याकहलाती है ग्लाइकोसुरिया कौन सी बीमारीमें होता है डायबिटीज मेलिटस में होता हैठीक है सर ये तो समझ में आ गया अब मुझेबताइए सर ग्लूकोज अगर नहीं जाएगा तो ऊर्जाकैसे मिलेगी सर ग्लूकोज अगर अंदर नहीं जारहा है ग्लूकोज अंदर नहीं जा रहा है एटीपीतो श्वसन से बनती है श्वसन प्रक्रिया सेएटीपी बनती है ग्लूकोज अगर नहीं जाएगा तोइस कंडीशन में हम अंदर जो फैट है अंदर जोवसा है उसको तोड़ेंगे और उसको जब हमतोड़ते हैं तो एक अपशिष्ट पदार्थ बनता हैजिसका नाम होता है कीटोनबॉडीज कीटोनकाय कीटोन काय बनते हैं तो मैंने आपसेक्या बोला कि भाई जब ग्लूकोज नहीं जाएगातो श्वसन तो करना है ऊर्जा तो बनानी हैबिना ऊर्जा के तो कोशिका खत्म हो जाएगी तोइस परिस्थिति में जब शर्करा नहीं होएगीग्लूकोज नहीं होएगा कार्बोहाइड्रेट नहींहोएगी तो हमें वसा को तोड़ा वसा को तोड़ातो एक अपशिष्ट पदार्थ बना क्या कीटोनबॉडीज इस कीटोन बॉडीज को निकाल करर रक्तमें डालेंगे और यह कीटोन बॉडीज कीटोन काहै मूत्र के द्वारा निकलेगा इसको हम बोलतेहैं कीटोन रिया इस परिस्थिति को हम क्याबोलते हैं कीटो नूरिया तो बेटा डायबिटीजमेलिटस में ये दोनों कंडीशन दिखती है क्यामूत्र में ग्लूकोज भी होता है और कीटोनकाय भी होते हैं याद रखना इतनी सी बात जोआपको समझा थी अब है इसके अलावा हमारे अंदरमेन उत्सर्जन अंग कौन था किडनी क्या इसकेअलावा भी उत्सर्जन अंग होते हैं यसबिल्कुल होते हैं हमारे फेफड़े होते हैंहमारा यकृत होती है हमारी त्वचा होती हैजरा सोचिए हमारे फेफड़े क्या कार्बनडाइऑक्साइड नहीं निकाल रहे बिल्कुल निकालरहे हैं हमारा यकृत जो होता है याद रखनाइस यकृत से इस यकृत से भूलना जाइएगाबिलीरूबिन बिली वर्डन कोलेस्ट्रॉलस्टेरॉइड हार्मोन विटामिन औषधि आदि यह जोलिखा हुआ है यह सब मिलते हैं किसमें हमारेहमारे यकृत में एक रस बनता है जिसका नामहोता है पिस जिसमें से पर्ट ली बिलीरूबिनबिलीवर्डन बिलीरूबिन बिली वर्डन यह वर्णक होतेहैं जो पित्त रस को रंग देते हैं पित्त कोरंग देते हैं बाइल जूस को कलर देते हैं येनीला सॉरी हरा पीला रंग देते हैं हरा पीलारंग देते हैं और इनका कोई काम नहीं होताये वेस्ट होते हैं यह हमारे यकृत के हमारेलीवर का वेस्ट मटेरियल होता है याद रखनाअपशिष्ट पदार्थ होता है हमारे यकृत का कौनबिलीरूबिन और बिली वर्डन जिसको हम अपनेशरीर से त्यागआपको पता है मल पॉटी जिसको हम बोलते हैंउसका कलर पीला होता है हमारे मूत्र का रंगपीला होता है किसके कारण था सर अभी अभीआपने बताया था मूत्र का कलर जो पीला रंगजो था वो एक वर्ण के कारण था यूरोक्रोम येयूरोक्रोम किससे बनता है यह यूरोक्रोमइन्हीं बिलीरूबिन बिली वर्डन से बनता हैजो मल का पीला रंग जो होता है इन्हीं वर्णको के कारण होता है यानी इन वर्ण को को हमशरीर से त्याग रहे हैं किसके साथ मल केसाथ में समझ में आया भूल ना जाइएगा तोयकृत भी एक उत्सर्जी अंग है हां है फुफूसभी फेफड़े भी उत्सर्जी अंग है हां है जरासोचिए हमारी त्वचा से त्वचा से कहीं नाकहीं क्या निकलता है पसीना नहीं निकलतातेल नहीं निकलता जरा सोचिए आपकी त्वचा मेंश्वेत ग्रंथि श्वेत ग्रंथि यानी पसीनेवाली ग्रंथि है ना और तेल ग्रंथि यानीसीबम ग्रंथियां बोलते हैं इनको सीबम बोलतेहैं ये क्या है जरा सोच आपकी आपकी त्वचासे क्या निकल रहा है पसीना निकल रहा है इसपसीने में आपके क्या होते है बेटा जी इसपसीने में आपके यूरिया तक होता है हां यादरखना आपके पसीने में यूरिया तक होता है अबजरा सोच यूरिया बाहर निकल रहा है सर मूत्रसे निकलता है बहुत माइन्यूट अमाउंट मेंपसीने से भी बाहर निकल तो पसीना एक मैं येनहीं बोलूंगा कि उत्सर्जी पदार्थ है पसीनाएक्चुअली निकलता किसलिए ताकि शरीर कातापमान मेंटेन किया जा सके लेकिन अगर निकलरहा है इस पसीने में उत्सर्जी पदार्थ निकलरहे हैं तो हम त्वचा को क्या बोलेंगे येभी एक उत्सर्जन अंग तेल ग्रंथियां क्याहोता है भाई साहब इसमें तेल होता है क्याहोता है ये तेल होता है और ये तेल जो होताहै हमारे ऊपर एक सुरक्षात्मक कवच बनाता हैलेकिन इस तेल के द्वारा हमारा उत्सर्जीपदार्थ जो है वो भी तो निकल रहा हैबिल्कुल निकलता है शरीर से यूरिया लैक्टिकअम्ल ये सारे के सारे किससे निकल रहे हैंपसीने से निकल रहे हैं उसके अलावा तेलग्रंथियों से जो शिवम बनता है जो तेल जोबनता है उसमें स्टेरल्स होते हैं स्टेरल्सएक प्रकार की वसा होती है हाइड्रोकार्बंसहोते हैं मोम जैसे पदार्थ का क्या होता हैनिष्कासन होता है हालांकि ये हमें सुरक्षादे रहे हैं हमारी त्वचा को सुरक्षा दे रहेहैं लेकिन हमारे शरीर से निकल तो रहे हैंना ये वेस्ट मटेरियल तो तेल ग्रंथियां औरश्वेद ग्रंथि यानी पसीने की ग्रंथियां औरतेल ग्रंथियां जो त्वचा में है जिनसेउत्सर्जी पदार्थ निकल रहे हैं तो त्वचा भीक्या है एक उत्सर्जन अंग है फेफड़े भीक्या है एक उत्सर्जन अंग है यकृत भी क्याहै एक उत्सर्जन अंग है लास्ट में एक लाइनलिखी हुई थी यहां पर क्या आप जानते हैं किकुछ नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट का निष्कासन लार केद्वारा होता है हमारी लार में भी कुछउत्सर्जी पदार्थ होते हैं बताऊं कौन साहोता है आपसे पूछा गया मैं आपको बता देताहूं कौन होता है यूरिक एसिड यूरिक एसिड जोहोता है ना वो हमारी लार में होता है यादरखना भूल ना जाइएगा आखिरी टॉपिक वृक्ष सेसंबंधित विकृतियां भैया सीधी सी बात हैअगर किसी की किडनी खराब हो जाती है तो दोही कंडीशन है अगर किसी की किडनी फेल हो गईहै किसी की किडनी फेल हो गई है किसी कीकिडनी काम नहीं कर रही है तो उससे क्याहोता है यूरिमिया होता हैयूरेमबम क्या कर रही थी रक्त को छान रहीथी रक्त को छान रही थी यानी कुल मिलाकरक्या कर रही थी रक्त में से अपशिष्टपदार्थ यूरिया को निकालकर मूत्र बना रहीथी जरा सोच किडनी काम नहीं कर रही है उसकीवक्रांगी जिसमें किडनी ने काम करना बंद करदिया है ओके सर अब दो में से अगर एक खराबहो जाती है तो हम एक के सहारे जिंदा रहसकते हैं ऐसा नहीं है कि नहीं रह सकता रहसकते है थोड़ी सी कठिनाइयां आती है लेकिनरह सकते हैं अब दोनों ही खराब हो गई तोफिर भैया फिर कोई सहारा नहीं है है ना तोउस कंडीशन में दो चीजें होती हैं किडनीफेल हो गई है शरीर के अंदर यूरिया बढ़ताजा रहा है क्योंकि छन नहीं रहा है इसकंडीशन को क्या बोलते हैं यूरेनिया बोलतेहैं जब शरीर में क्या बढ़ता जाता हैयूरिया बढ़ता जाता है इसमें दो कंडीशनहोती है एक होता है डायलिसिस जिसको हमक्या बोलते हैं रक्त अपोहनहीमोडायलिसिस रक्त अपोहन और दूसरा तरीकाहोता है सीधाक्या स्थानांतरण किडनी काट्रांसप्लांटेशन क्या किडनी का क्या करालो भैया ट्रांसप्लांटेशन कहला लो क्या वृककी क्रिया हीनता का दूर करने का अंतिमउपाय है वृक का प्रत्यारोपण किडनी काट्रांसप्लांटेशन या तो डायलिसिस कराओ याट्रांसप्लांटेशन कराओ पहले डायलिसिस करायाजाता है सर डायलिसिस में होता क्या हैध्यान से देखिएगा बेटा डायलिसिस में क्याकरते हैं देख मेरे भाई डायलिसिस में एकयंत्र होता है रक्त अपोहन यंत्र बोलते हैंजिसकेअंदर इस तरीके से एक नलिका होतीहै ठीक है क्या करते हैं एक पेशेंट कापेशेंट की शेरा लेतेहैंकिसकी पेशेंट की क्या लेते हैं शिरा लेतेहैं जिसके अंदर अशुद्ध रक्त होगा हा सरउस अशुद्ध रक्त से सॉरी उसकी शिरा नहींलेंगे उसकी धमनी लेंगे माफ करना क्यालेंगे उसकी धमनी ले रहे हैं क्योंकि धमनीहै ना उस धमनी मेंहै कौन सी थी याद कर वो वृक धमनी थी वृकधमनी याद करो वो वृक धम मैं यहां कह रहाहूं वृक धमनी थी अंदर धमनी जा रही थी उसीमें तो था क्या था बेटा जी आपका अशुद्धरक्त तो पेशेंट की धमनी ली उस धमनी मेंअशुद्ध रक्त है हार वह अशुद्ध रक्त इसनलिका से होता हुआ जाएगा यह जो नलिका होतीहै य सेलो फेन नलिका कहलाती है सेलोफेननलिका ठीक है सर आगे क्या होगा अ इधरदेखना इस नलिका के बाहर इस नलिका केबाहर तरलहैजो बिल्कुल सेम टू सेम उसमें वही सारीचीजें मिल रही है जो यहां से रक्त आ रहाहै ना जिसमें नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट पदार्थ हैकहां पर है उसकी प्लाज्मा में बिल्कुल सेमटू सेम यहां पर जो तरल जोएगा उसमेंबिल्कुलसेमप्लाज्मा के सभी पदार्थमिलेंगे प्लाज्मा के समान सभी पदार्थमिलेंगे सिवायएक्सेप्ट नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्टके सिवाय किसको छोड़कर नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्टको छोड़कर अब जरा सोच यहां पर नाइट्रोजनअपशिष्ट हैहांदेखो ये रक्त है इस रक्त में अपशिष्टपदार्थ है हां कहां पर है उसकी प्लाज्मामें हमने बाहर भी प्लाज्मा रख रखी बिल्कुलसेम टू सेम बाहर का जो कंपोजीशन है इस तरलका वो बिल्कुल सेम टू सेम प्लाज्मा है बसबाहर क्या नहीं नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट नहीं हैअब जरा सोच यहां पर जब नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्टआएंगे तो वो बाहर नहीं निकल जाएंगे विसरणनहीं हो जाएगा भाई जरा सोचिए जितना अंदरग्लूकोज है उतना बाहर ग्लूकोज है बाहरनिकलेगा ग्लूकोज जितना अंदर जल है उतना हीबाहर जल है जल निकलेगा बाहर जितना अंदरसोडियम क्लोराइड है उतना बाहर सोडियमक्लोराइड है बाहर निकलेगा सोडियम क्लोराइडनहीं ना लेकिन अंदर नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट हैबाहर नहीं है तो नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट कहांनिकल जाएंगे साहब बाहर आ जाएंगे कहां आजाएंगे बाहर आ जाएंगे और नाइट्रोजनअपशिष्ट अगर बाहर आ जाएंगे तो फाइनली यहांसे जो रक्त बाहरनिकलेगा उसमें नाइट्रोजन अपशिष्ट नहीं हैयही क्या कहला रहा है रक्त अपोहन कहलाताहै इसी को ही हम क्या बोलते हैंहीमोडायलिसिस रक्त अपोहन बोलते हैं यहीचीज यहां से यहां तक लिखी हुई है ठीक हैठीक है सो हम रोगी की धमनी लेते हैं उसमेंहम क्या डालते हैं हेपरिन डालते ताकि रक्तका थक्का ना बने इसलिए हिप भी डालते हैंथक्का ना बने हेपरिन जो होता है थक्काबनने से रोकता है क्योंकि भैया बाहरनिकालने वाले बाहर निकालेंगे भाई रक्त जबएयर के कांटेक्ट में आता है तो रक्त काथक्का बन जाता है ना आप जानते हैं तो आपचाहते हो कि इस कंडीशन में रक्त का थक्काबने नहीं ना आपको तो रक्त को क्या करना हैसाफ करना है तो रक्त हि पेरिन डालते ताकिरक्त का थक्का ना बने बाकी सारी चीजें वहीहै और यहां पर एक चीज लिखी हुई है क्याभैया फाइनल उपचार जो होएगा वो यही होएगाक्या कि भैया वृक का प्रत्यारोपण कर दोअगर फिर भी डायलिसिस से काम नहीं चल रहाहै तो वृक का क्या कर दो प्रत्यारोपण करदो ठीक है इसके बाद में बेटा जी यहां परअब किससे प्रत्यारोपण किससे किया जाएगानिकट संबंधियों से किया जाएगा टेस्ट होतेहैं एचएलए टेस्ट होते है ह्यूमनल्यूकोसाइट एंटीजन टेस्ट होते हैं कई सारेटेस्ट होते हैं जिसमें चेकिंग की जाती हैकि आप प्रत्यारोपण कर पाएंगे भी कि नहींकर पाएंगे और आप यह भी जानते हैंप्रत्यारोपण से रोकने के लिए कहीं ना कहींहमारे अंदर प्रतिरक्षा होती है कौन सीकोशिका मध्य प्रतिरक्षा मानव अ मानवस्वास्थ्य और रोग चैप्टर में आपने पढ़ा थायाद करिए सेल मीडिएट इम्युनिटी याद आ रहाहै है ना और आपको यह भी याद आ रहा होगासाइक्लोस्पोरा ए भूले तो नहीं है ना है नाचल सो दो रोग यहां पर लिखे हुए हैं बेटाजी रीनल कैलक आ कहीं ना कहीं किडनी केअंदर

war when the entire world waspressurizing us to buy oil at a premiumDr J Shankar protected us from thepressure of the West so that we couldget discounted oil from Russia and thathelped India curb inflation in 2021 ifyou're looking at energy purchases fromRussia I would suggest that yourattention should be focused on Europebut I suspect looking at the figuresprobably uh our total purchases for themonth would be less than what Europedoes in an afteron tell me buyingRussian gas is not funding the W I meanwhy is it's only Indian money and oilcoming to India which funds but it's notgas coming to Europe which FS while theentire world got divided betweensupporting the US and Russia during theRussia Ukraine war we were verystrategically able to sell our servicesto the US and buy oil from Russia theRussian military has began a brutalassault on on the people ofUkraine without provocation withoutjustification without necessity this isa premeditated attack he's attacked afriendly country without any[Music]provocation while didn't openly supportMoscow in its invasion of Ukraine Europehas to grow out of the mindset thatEurope's problems are the world'sproblems but the world's problems arenot Europe's problems so we wereliterally in The Sweet Spot of WorldTrade without getting sanctionedsimilarly now when the world is dividedinto two parts because of the IsraelPalestine conflict because of ourdiplomacy again we are best friends bothwith the Israelis as well as the Arabsnow 99% of India Only Knows up to thispoint but what they don't know is thatthis diplomatic non-alliance strategyeven during the most critical times hasgiven India a golden instrument ofgrowth this instrument is called theIndia Middle East economic Corridor totell you about it in September 2023 inthe G20 Summit India us UA Germany Italyand EU we all came together to sign anagreement that will put India at thecenter of World Trade global leadersannounced a historic economictrade Asia or Europe economicand the upcoming economic Corridor isbeing built as an alternative to China'sPR and this agreement is so so crucialthat all leaders across the world fromMuhammad bin Salman to Netanyahu to evenBiden have addressed this Corridor as acrucial instrument of growth for theworld economy and this route haseverything from shipping lanes toRailways to even under sea cables andsolar grids passing through countrieswith a GDP of $47 trillionand cherry on the cake this is perhapsthe best strategy for us to counter therising power of China this is one of themost important contributions of Dr JShankar and his diplomatic Mastery overinternational relations so in thisepisode today let's try to understandwhat is this India Middle East economicCorridor how did J Shankar's diplomacyhelp us build the India Middle Easteconomic Corridor how will it help theeconomy of India and most importantlywhat are the business lessons that wecan learn from this diplomatic Masteryof Indiabut before we continue let me introduceyou to our education partners of today'sepisode and that is growth school peoplealways remember there is no shortcutwhen it comes to your career andbusiness and the only way to reduce riskin your career and stay relevant is toupskill and one such skill is usingartificial intelligence if you want tostay ahead in your career game you canlearn Ai and that to for free with

will change the way you work inyour profession you can use AI toanalyze vast data sets from excellentseconds make pbds in just a few minutesand even look for a job get salary hikeand promotion in your company over onemillion people across the globeincluding me and my team have attendedthis Workshop where we derived an insanevalue created our personal AI assistantand did our tasks 10x faster so whetheryou are a tech or non-tech professionalin sales marketing HR operations or evena founder of freelancer this Workshopwill be extremely useful for you I'veleft the link in the description so goand check it[Music]out as usual let's start with the basicsyou see the EU and us are India'sbiggest trading partners and we trademore than100 billion worth of goods andas of now our trade happens through asingle shipping route this route is noneother than the Red Sea Swiss Canal routeand here's where there is a big bigproblem so if a cloth manufacturer inMumbai wants to send his products toGreece he would load his Goods in a shipat gmpt Port and then this ship wouldpass through the Arabian Sea get intothe Red Sea via babble day and then itwould cross the busy Swiss Canal to getinto the Mediterranean Sea and finallyit would reach Europe this journey takesanywhere between 15 to 16 days similarly65% I repeat 65% of India's crude oilimports from Iraq and Saudi Arabia passthrough the Swiss canal and even a tradewith North Africa depends on this exactsame route now the reason why this is abig big problem is because if anythinghappens to this route our crude oilprices will will Skyrocket our exportswill become costly and the Indianeconomy will be drastically affectedbecause if this route is closed then theships will have to go all the way downto the Cape of Good Hope around Africaand then reach India and this route willadd another 8,900 km to the shippingroute and two more weeks to the shippingtime as a result the cost of a Goodswill shoot up and inflation will happenin India now you might say bro what areyou saying we've been using this routefor 150 years now then how is thissuddenly a problemtoday well firstly it is estimated that30% of the container volumes and 12% ofthe international trade occurs throughthis region so there is a lot of trafficin this single Channel and what makesmatters worse is that out of this 190kilom odd Swiss Canal about 80 km as inhalf of this canal is just a single Laneso if any ship gets stuck over here oreven if there is a minor bombing thathappens in this Lane this Lane will beclosed for a very long time in fact weall know what happened in 2021 when aship got stuck in this canal for just 6days right now it's one of the world'smost important shipping routes and it'sblocked a giant container ship wedgedfrom bank to bank blocking one of theworld's most important shipping lanesbut this is no ordinary Highway blockagenearly 19,000 ships pass through a yearmore than 50 a day carrying around 12%of the World's Trade volume ever givenwhich I'm sure you've been following isis 400 m long carrying 18,000 containersand it's been wedged across the canal sojust because of this one ship a largechunk of the World Trade was stoppedthere were huge delays and losses to theTraders and insurance premiums went upas a result there was a temporary Tradecrisis a shipping crisis and shortage ofgoods were felt all across the world soin short this is a very small andcongested route for World Trade secondlythere is a lot of geopolitical tensionin this region and a classic example thesame is the Red Sea conflict the war inGaza has spilled over into the Red Seawith the hoodis attacking commercialvessels in the globally criticalwater Iran is not doing anything hisbahis not retaliating but Yemen's huis aredoing a lot and if you remember from ourexample because of the Red Sea conflictbecause this region was blocked againthe ships had to go all the way down tothe ape of Good Hope and around Africato reach Europe so again shipping costand time both shot up this is how thisconflict alone increased the shippingcost by 40 to 60% and caused delays ofre-rooting by 20 days eventually to leadto a 15 15 to 20% high in insurancepremium and a ton of headache to theIndian Industries this is a secondproblem with the existing trade routeand lastly whenever a ship passesthrough the Swiss Canal they have to pay$400,000 to 700 ,000 to Egypt as a formof tax almost like toll tax which againincreases the cost of trade these arethe major problems with the existingSwiss Canal route so now the question iswhat do we do we can't stop theterrorist from attacking and we cannotcontrol geopolitics and the onlyalternate route that we have addsanother 8,900 km to the shipping routeso what exactly is thesolution well it is shocking to knowthat the entire world has been stuckwith this problem for one 150 years sothe question is what can we dodifferently now well ladies andgentlemen this is a reason why we havesomething called the India Middle Easteconomic Corridor which has beenproposed by India us Europe and the ArabNations so the question over here iswhat is so magical about this route thatit is now able to solve a 150y oldproblem well let's try to understandthis by taking the same example asbefore so let's say the same Trader inMumbai wants to send his clothes toEurope and he's not not able to use theRed Sea route due to the geopoliticalconflict but this time instead of thelong route from the Cape of Good Hope hehas a better alternative and that is theIMC or India Middle East economicCorridor IMC has two legs an Eastern legand a western leg in the Eastern leg hewould simply use the Indian ports likeMundra or gmpd and this ship would takehis Goods to a middle eastern Port likejabali port in the UA then these Goodswould move by rail from the jabel portin UAE to Israel's hafia port on theMediterranean Coast after transitingthrough Saudi Arabia and Jordan and thenthe Western leg of the corridor wouldput these containers back on the shipsin hafia and then take them to Europeanports across the European Union andhere's where we have territories likeFrance Italy and Germany eventually allthese Goods will reach their respectivedestinations in Europe so do you realizepeople we are breaking the 150y oldbottleneck and more importantly theIsraeli and the Arabs have never hadsuch a wonderful relationship in thehistory of the world and this routeladies and gentlemen is so so crucialthat it gives us three incrediblesuperpowers firstly it reduces ourdependence on the Swiss Canal secondlyit could be 40% faster becausehigh-speed freight trains would travelat 120 km per hour which is literallyfour times faster than the ships so thisroute is both 30% cheaper and 40% fasteras compared to the Swiss Canal route andcherry on the cake this route willstrengthen our relationship with Europeus and the Arab countries by a largelarge extent so do you realize in spiteof being best friends with Russia Europeand us both are signing such animportant deal with us in spite of theIsrael Palestine conflict we are bestwins both with the Israelis and theArabs so much so that we are buildingthe most revolutionary trade route inthe history of the world and that totogether this is the power of having astrong diplomatic relationship evenduring the times of conflict and this iswhat I consider to be one of the mostimportant contributions of Dr ja Shankerand guess what the story doesn't endhere do you see this map these arenothing but data cables that connect theentire world to the internet and everysingle country and continent that hasinternet today is directly or indirectlyconnected to this vast network of cablesso when you send an Instagram real toyour friend in the us the data typicallytravels through a series of cables itstarts from your device and each packetof data including video text or image itis rooted through the most efficientpath possible to reach its destinationand this packet travels throughthousands of miles under the ocean toreach your friend's phone in the US andthis infrastructure is extremely crucialbecause it supports not just personalCommunications but even digitalCommunications like businesstransactions streaming services and muchmore and this cable infrastructure is soso important that 95% I repeat 95% ofour communication data flows throughthese cables so if someone cuts offthese cables that particular country orcontinent will either lose access to theinternet or will see a significant dropin its internet capability and just likehow the Red Sea route is a maritimechoke point this is an undersea datachoke point of the world and you knowwhat guys just like the houti rebelsattacked cargo ships in the Babel Mondaythey even attacked the undersea cablesin March and damaged these cables andthis is what happened after that cableWarfare is Raging posing a grave threatto Global Communication three underseacables in the Red Sea have been cut as aresult global internet andtelecommunication traffic of Asiaincluding India Europe and the MiddleEast has been rerooted the Red Sea isthe chief Target for ven's Ry Rebels andyou know they say that if you blind asoldier for a minute you have control ofof his life and if you blind a nationfor 24 hours you can take control ofthat nation and these data cables are agateway to choke Us in such a way thatAny Nation can take control of us ifthey blind us for 24 hours so in shortwe need to protect this data cable chokepoint at any cost the question is how dowe do it well this is where there is abattle between China and the US tocapture the undersea cable network totell you about it as of now Americancompanies have most of the control ofthese undersea cables but in the past 10years China has been laying its owncables and it's been connecting EuropeAfrica and Asia with its own data cablesin fact by 2025 they aim to have 60%market share in the undersea data cablemarket so if you see this chart there'sa company called hmn Tech which is aChinese cable company their underseacables are connecting Africa SouthAmerica Pakistan Sri Lanka and evenother European and Middle Easterncountries but just like solar ingots andlithium here if we become dependent onChina we are literally giving away ourLifeline to our Rivals so India justcannot afford to let this situationhappen this is the reason why again IMChas planned something called trans EURAsia cable system this is a 20,000 kmcable network which will connect Mumbaiand martial in France and just like theimsc trade route avoided the Swiss Canalroute this submarine cable will avoidthe maritime choke point and go via landthrough UAE and Saudi Arabia this is asecond risk that IMC is helping Indiaavoid and lastly there's somethingcalled the interconnected solar grid andhydrogen Corridor solar grid issomething that I've already covered inour previous case stud so we attach thelink to it in the description forhydrogen we will again cover it in aseparate episode if you would love toknow about the hydrogen Corridor but asof now I think it's already informationoverload so let's SK it for this timebut long story short both theinterconnected solar grid and thehydrogen Corridor will help us adoptrenewable energy faster than ever thisis how the Diplomatic Master stroke ofIndia is giving us the superpower ofbypassing the Swiss Canal is helping usbring down the cost of shipping by 30%it is helping us bring down the time ofshipping by 40% it is helping us protectour data cables and most importantlythis route will put us in the perfectsweet spot to trade with the West whileholding a healthy relationship withRussia this is the power of diplomacy ininternational relations and eventactually it brings us to the last partof the episode and that are the lessonsthat we need to learn from this iconicposition of India in World economylesson number one unless a conflicthappens in your backyard it is not yourbusiness to be worried about othersproblems in this case while RussiaUkraine have been fighting while us andRussia have been fighting we minded ourown business and did what is best for usand did not align with anyone lessonnumber two there is a wise saying whichsays that in geopolitics there are nofriends only interests which meansinternational relations are privprimarily driven by strategic economicand security considerations rather thanemotional Affinity in this case nomatter how much we feel for the peopleof Ukraine we cannot align ourselveswith anyone because if we do we will putour economy at risk and our people atrisk and as much as this sounds brutaleven as entrepreneurs we need tounderstand that a business relationshipwith no economic or Strategic Benefit isnot a business relationship at all sohave healthy relationships but not atthe cost of your business and thisespecially applies for those clients whosay do this project for us for free andwe will get you more clients with ourreferrals and lastly always rememberdiplomacy is the art of telling peopleto go to hell in such a way that theystart asking you for directions I repeatdiplomacy is the art of telling peopleto go to hell in such a way that theystart asking you for directions and Dr JShanker is clearly great at it so thequestion is as entrepreneurs are wemastering the art of diplomacy reflecton this question and let me know in thecomments that's all from my side fortoday guys if you learn somethingvaluable please make sure to hit thelike button

Swiss canal and even a tradewith North Africa depends on this exactsame route now the reason why this is abig big problem is because if anythinghappens to this route our crude oilprices will will Skyrocket our exportswill become costly and the Indianeconomy will be drastically affectedbecause if this route is closed then theships will have to go all the way downto the Cape of Good Hope around Africaand then reach India and this route willadd another 8,900 km to the shippingroute and two more weeks to the shippingtime as a result the cost of a Goodswill shoot up and inflation will happenin India now you might say bro what areyou saying we've been using this routefor 150 years now then how is thissuddenly a problemtoday well firstly it is estimated that30% of the container volumes and 12% ofthe international trade occurs throughthis region so there is a lot of trafficin this single Channel and what makesmatters worse is that out of this 190kilom odd Swiss Canal about 80 km as inhalf of this canal is just a single Laneso if any ship gets stuck over here oreven if there is a minor bombing thathappens in this Lane this Lane will beclosed for a very long time in fact weall know what happened in 2021 when aship got stuck in this canal for just 6days right now it's one of the world'smost important shipping routes and it'sblocked a giant container ship wedgedfrom bank to bank blocking one of theworld's most important shipping lanesbut this is no ordinary Highway blockagenearly 19,000 ships pass through a yearmore than 50 a day carrying around 12%of the World's Trade volume ever givenwhich I'm sure you've been following isis 400 m long carrying 18,000 containersand it's been wedged across the canal sojust because of this one ship a largechunk of the World Trade was stoppedthere were huge delays and losses to theTraders and insurance premiums went upas a result there was a temporary Tradecrisis a shipping crisis and shortage ofgoods were felt all across the world soin short this is a very small andcongested route for World Trade secondlythere is a lot of geopolitical tensionin this region and a classic example thesame is the Red Sea conflict the war inGaza has spilled over into the Red Seawith the hoodis attacking commercialvessels in the globally criticalwater Iran is not doing anything hisbahis not retaliating but Yemen's huis aredoing a lot and if you remember from ourexample because of the Red Sea conflictbecause this region was blocked againthe ships had to go all the way down tothe ape of Good Hope and around Africato reach Europe so again shipping costand time both shot up this is how thisconflict alone increased the shippingcost by 40 to 60% and caused delays ofre-rooting by 20 days eventually to leadto a 15 15 to 20% high in insurancepremium and a ton of headache to theIndian Industries this is a secondproblem with the existing trade routeand lastly whenever a ship passesthrough the Swiss Canal they have to pay$400,000 to 700 ,000 to Egypt as a formof tax almost like toll tax which againincreases the cost of trade these arethe major problems with the existingSwiss Canal route so now the question iswhat do we do we can't stop theterrorist from attacking and we cannotcontrol geopolitics and the onlyalternate route that we have addsanother 8,900 km to the shipping routeso what exactly is thesolution well it is shocking to knowthat the entire world has been stuckwith this problem for one 150 years sothe question is what can we dodifferently now well ladies andgentlemen this is a reason why we havesomething called the India Middle Easteconomic Corridor which has beenproposed by India us Europe and the ArabNations so the question over here iswhat is so magical about this route thatit is now able to solve a 150y oldproblem well let's try to understandthis by taking the same example asbefore so let's say the same Trader inMumbai wants to send his clothes toEurope and he's not not able to use theRed Sea route due to the geopoliticalconflict but this time instead of thelong route from the Cape of Good Hope hehas a better alternative and that is theIMC or India Middle East economicCorridor IMC has two legs an Eastern legand a western leg in the Eastern leg hewould simply use the Indian ports likeMundra or gmpd and this ship would takehis Goods to a middle eastern Port likejabali port in the UA then these Goodswould move by rail from the jabel portin UAE to Israel's hafia port on theMediterranean Coast after transitingthrough Saudi Arabia and Jordan and thenthe Western leg of the corridor wouldput these containers back on the shipsin hafia and then take them to Europeanports across the European Union andhere's where we have territories likeFrance Italy and Germany eventually allthese Goods will reach their respectivedestinations in Europe so do you realizepeople we are breaking the 150y oldbottleneck and more importantly theIsraeli and the Arabs have never hadsuch a wonderful relationship in thehistory of the world and this routeladies and gentlemen is so so crucialthat it gives us three incrediblesuperpowers firstly it reduces ourdependence on the Swiss Canal secondlyit could be 40% faster becausehigh-speed freight trains would travelat 120 km per hour which is literallyfour times faster than the ships so thisroute is both 30% cheaper and 40% fasteras compared to the Swiss Canal route andcherry on the cake this route willstrengthen our relationship with Europeus and the Arab countries by a largelarge extent so do you realize in spiteof being best friends with Russia Europeand us both are signing such animportant deal with us in spite of theIsrael Palestine conflict we are bestwins both with the Israelis and theArabs so much so that we are buildingthe most revolutionary trade route inthe history of the world and that totogether this is the power of having astrong diplomatic relationship evenduring the times of conflict and this iswhat I consider to be one of the mostimportant contributions of Dr ja Shankerand guess what the story doesn't endhere do you see this map these arenothing but data cables that connect theentire world to the internet and everysingle country and continent that hasinternet today is directly or indirectlyconnected to this vast network of cablesso when you send an Instagram real toyour friend in the us the data typicallytravels through a series of cables itstarts from your device and each packetof data including video text or image itis rooted through the most efficientpath possible to reach its destinationand this packet travels throughthousands of miles under the ocean toreach your friend's phone in the US andthis infrastructure is extremely crucialbecause it supports not just personalCommunications but even digitalCommunications like businesstransactions streaming services and muchmore and this cable infrastructure is soso important that 95% I repeat 95% ofour communication data flows throughthese cables so if someone cuts offthese cables that particular country orcontinent will either lose access to theinternet or will see a significant dropin its internet capability and just likehow the Red Sea route is a maritimechoke point this is an undersea datachoke point of the world and you knowwhat guys just like the houti rebelsattacked cargo ships in the Babel Mondaythey even attacked the undersea cablesin March and damaged these cables andthis is what happened after that cableWarfare is Raging posing a grave threatto Global Communication three underseacables in the Red Sea have been cut as aresult global internet andtelecommunication traffic of Asiaincluding India Europe and the MiddleEast has been rerooted the Red Sea isthe chief Target for ven's Ry Rebels andyou know they say that if you blind asoldier for a minute you have control ofof his life and if you blind a nationfor 24 hours you can take control ofthat nation and these data cables are agateway to choke Us in such a way thatAny Nation can take control of us ifthey blind us for 24 hours so in shortwe need to protect this data cable chokepoint at any cost the question is how dowe do it well this is where there is abattle between China and the US tocapture the undersea cable network totell you about it as of now Americancompanies have most of the control ofthese undersea cables but in the past 10years China has been laying its owncables and it's been connecting EuropeAfrica and Asia with its own data cablesin fact by 2025 they aim to have 60%market share in the undersea data cablemarket so if you see this chart there'sa company called hmn Tech which is aChinese cable company their underseacables are connecting Africa SouthAmerica Pakistan Sri Lanka and evenother European and Middle Easterncountries but just like solar ingots andlithium here if we become dependent onChina we are literally giving away ourLifeline to our Rivals so India justcannot afford to let this situationhappen this is the reason why again IMChas planned something called trans EURAsia cable system this is a 20,000 kmcable network which will connect Mumbaiand martial in France and just like theimsc trade route avoided the Swiss Canalroute this submarine cable will avoidthe maritime choke point and go via landthrough UAE and Saudi Arabia this is asecond risk that IMC is helping Indiaavoid and lastly there's somethingcalled the interconnected solar grid andhydrogen Corridor solar grid issomething that I've already covered inour previous case stud so we attach thelink to it in the description forhydrogen we will again cover it in aseparate episode if you would love toknow about the hydrogen Corridor but asof now I think it's already informationoverload so let's SK it for this timebut long story short both theinterconnected solar grid and thehydrogen Corridor will help us adoptrenewable energy faster than ever thisis how the Diplomatic Master stroke ofIndia is giving us the superpower ofbypassing the Swiss Canal is helping usbring down the cost of shipping by 30%it is helping us bring down the time ofshipping by 40% it is helping us protectour data cables and most importantlythis route will put us in the perfectsweet spot to trade with the West whileholding a healthy relationship withRussia this is the power of diplomacy ininternational relations and eventactually it brings us to the last partof the episode and that are the lessonsthat we need to learn from this iconicposition of India in World economylesson number one unless a conflicthappens in your backyard it is not yourbusiness to be worried about othersproblems in this case while RussiaUkraine have been fighting while us andRussia have been fighting we minded ourown business and did what is best for usand did not align with anyone lessonnumber two there is a wise saying whichsays that in geopolitics there are nofriends only interests which meansinternational relations are privprimarily driven by strategic economicand security considerations rather thanemotional Affinity in this case nomatter how much we feel for the peopleof Ukraine we cannot align ourselveswith anyone because if we do we will putour economy at risk and our people atrisk and as much as this sounds brutaleven as entrepreneurs we need tounderstand that a business relationshipwith no economic or Strategic Benefit isnot a business relationship at all sohave healthy relationships but not atthe cost of your business and thisespecially applies for those clients whosay do this project for us for free andwe will get you more clients with ourreferrals and lastly always rememberdiplomacy is the art of telling peopleto go to hell in such a way that theystart asking you for directions I repeatdiplomacy is the art of telling peopleto go to hell in such a way that theystart asking you for directions and Dr JShanker is clearly great at it so thequestion is as entrepreneurs are wemastering the art of diplomacy reflecton this question and let me know in thecomments that's all from my side fortoday guys if you learn somethingvaluable please make sure to hit thelike button

Video script when it comes to the question of economywhich is going to benefit everybody thepolitics cannot be so disrupt Once Upona Time prime minister Rajiv Gandhi saidif I send one rupee to the beneficiaryhe ends up getting only 15 P adoptingtechnology Prime Ministers ensured thatthat kind of leakage doesn't happen onerup sent is one Rupee received one ofthe most crucial Ministries in Mod'scabinet the Ministry of Finance has beenENT trusted to Nala sitaraman she's oneof the top ministers in the governmentof India so only 1.5% of India'spopulation is the taxpaying populationwhereas for China this is 10% and in theUS it is 43% M why is our tax base sosmall as long as you are earning moreyou and your family are happy but themoment you are under the tax net youthink the government is regressive thereare states like Tamil Nadu which wereprotesting because they were saying thatit's like penalizing the states forinvesting so much money into buildingfactories when there are states that arejust consuming things is not buildingfactories what are you saying the top 1%of India accounted for 45% of allflights and just 6.5% of the users wereresponsible for 44% of all UPItransactions man why is the gap betweenthe rich and the poor increasing so muchman the skill India report says thatmore than 35% of our btech students areunemployable 30% of our MBA students areunemployable 60% of our it students areun unemployable and more than 75% of ourPolytechnic students are unemployablethe Finance Minister of Kerala Kenbalgopal argues he says that Kerala getsonly 21 Rupees against every 100 rupethat Kerala collects but for up thisnumber is 46 out of 100 and for Biharit's drastically High Bihar gets 70rupes out of the 100 rupe that itcollects and here's where the northsouth divide narrative comes intoplaymap so ma'am what is the logicbehind dividing this pool of money Ithink this narrative issomewhat[Music]distorted hi everybody this is aconversation that I had with one of themost powerful women in India who is noneother than our finance minister shrimatinirmala sitaraman in this episode wespoke at length on what exactly are theobstacles that India faces while it ison its way to become a $7 trillioneconomy why is there rampantunemployment in India what is the visionthat bjb has for India and mostimportantly we spoke at length on whySouthern States like Tamil Nadu andKerala get less money from the center ascompared to northern states like up andBihar so as usual I tried my level bestto ask her as many questions as possiblein the limited time that we had we didmiss out on a lot of questions but forthe questions that we could ask nirmalamaam was kind enough to explaineverything using examples and numbers soso now it's up to you to decide whetherour answers were satisfactory or not andnow on with theepisode hello ma'am welcome to theIndian business podcast and thank you somuch for giving us such an importantslot in your valuable schedule ma'am ma'the agenda for today's podcast is verysimple we want to understand thefundamental insights of great governancewhich usually gets missed out bymainstream media and I have veryspecific questions coming straight fromthe people of India and what we seek tostand are the underlying insights behindthe functioning of the government so allthroughout this episode if you can beextremely elaborative with your answersas simple as possible and with as manyexamples as possible that would befantastic ma'am shall we get startedokay yes and thank you for having meGanesh thank you so much ma'am ma'am thefirst question that I have comes fromyour India India today conclave answerand you mentioned that a critical factorto help us become a $7 trillion economyis the coordination between the statecenter and the panchayat ma could youplease elaborate on that and help meunderstand what is this coordinationissue and how are we solving forit see as youknow the governance structure inIndia is divided bysubjects as much as it is dividedprimarily between the centralgovernment the state government and ofcourse the Third thirdlayer so there are subjects as theyrefer to which are entirely the centralgovernment'sdomain and there are subjects which areentirely the state government'sdomains and there are those which haveboth ofthem they call it as concurrent subjectswhere both the center and the stateshave a role to play so even there youknowsome aspects of that subject will bedealt by the center and some otheraspects will be done by the states andtheoverlaps are kept to the minimumoverlaps even withinconcurrent so when we refer to thesubjects those can be fantastically doneby any one Center or the state but evenin those nowadays very clearlyuh the interests of thestates need to be given a voice and insubjects which are statesexclusively even their local bodiesbecause they're also elected they alsohave aspirations they have people'sRepresentatives sitting in them so theyare answerable back to the voters so thelocal self government or the third layeras we call Urban localbodies will also have a very decisiverole to play to The Limited area inwhich they operate but offlate the one big glitch to this wholething is being felt because localgovernments are not yet into thatGroove because eventually when you takea investment to some area it is in thatpocket where they have to be locatedmany of the clearances will have toemanate from andtherefore there is a need for the localbodies to understand why they have to beeasy with people who are coming easymeaning well within therules uh make it facilitative ratherthan uh obstructive because when youthink you want to regulate them controlthem or uh bring more rules on them youthink you're having a hold but that canfrighten people away from yourplace so it is that kind of aunderstanding and participating with thesame intent that you need to have allthe layers working together that's why Ihad said that could you help meunderstand this as an example ma'am anyexample will be let ussay uh now you're having all thesesemiconductor chipmanufacturing earlier you had themaruti uh was it uh that the smallestcar Nano Nano which was going to bemanufactured and where they went thestate government and the local body didnot make it easy for them and at thatpoint in time before 2014 electiontypical of Gujarat which was bristfriendly uh they said no you come overwe'll do it and therefore leaving thearea where it was to be established inBengal Tata rushed to sanand and theGujarat government together with thelocal body there enabled within I'm told10 days the permissions requiredclearances and everything so that theycould invest now uh without looking atany ill will or malfi why wouldn't thathappen in Bengal after all the sameInvestments by Tata was going to happenthere correct that insensitivity or callit indifference affected a big Prospectof a business similar is the way inwhich you have private Indian investorsgoing in formanufacturingsemiconductors it's no good repeatingthe example Gujarat offered themfavorable anyone could have offered andthat got proven by the fact that wouldyou imagine Assam gave them theopportunity you tend to think northeaststates need a lot more pushing up toeven be at par with many of the statesso that industry can go in there butwhat did Assam do differently from manyother states which in manufacturingexcept for core Industries like cementor something you don't have any of thosenew tech technology driven areas or umit driven industry being there but theydrew them yeah and uh hardned businesshouse like tatas found it possible toestablish not a c Factory not a you knowintegrated Steel factory but a verycoed semiconductor manufacturing placeso that is the point in which the stategovernment working together with localauthorities can do what you wouldotherwise in common sense think isimpossible if they only move that fastand understanding the need two examplesvery interesting ma'am ma'am youmentioned about ease of doing businessin Gujarat and I've read this countlesstimes in fact we' made a case studio inGujarat and we often found out that alot of entrepreneurs have given astatement publicly saying that it isvery easy for us to set up our factoriesin Gujarat versus in any other state infact ran Tata G himself gave out astatement that while many other stateswere offering Tata lands it was onlyGujarat that was not just offering butalso kept the land ready and that wasbecause of the land banking system in guGujarat and why is it that we have notbeen able to scale the land bankingsystem all across the country Ma'am whyonly guat I wouldn't think uh you rightin that there are many states which wentahead with land banking system keepingcertain demarked areas ready forindustry who will come forward and so onbut what is uh the distinction betweenuh what gujarat's approaches uh asregards the others compared to Gujaratis consistently they are doing it ohokay whereas in other states take theexample of Maharashtra after all thesame bullet train was approved inMaharashtra as well to be one of theterminal points for it the otherterminal point in Gujarat and it runs uhpartly through Gujarat and comes partlythrough parts of Northern Maharashtraand reach Mumbai yeah it was approvedokay it was all cleared Japanese came ina big way both for the technology andfor building the equality that isrequired for the track Ling for the thebridges which are going to hold them andeverything else but what happened with achange of government that particularagreement or understanding was put inthe back burner so from the terminalpoint in Gujarat till almost the borderof Maharashtra the work was almost 2/3complete but they had to Halt theycouldn't come further here becauseMaharashtra changed its approach to theproject now a project like that whichinvolves overseas investors overseastechnology having agreed and a centralgovernment which is working to get theseoverseas because most of the overseasloans when they come they come to thestates for their projects but theguarantor is the centralgovernment now with all this donesuddenly when a change of governmenthappens and for you for politicalconsiderations you say it's not requiredfor me the impact it has on the overalluh approach to making investment inIndia attractive just Falls flat allright then again with a change ofgovernment that's getting restored allright okay now what happens to theoverall completion of project it getsdelay what happens to that portion ofthe project which got delayed and itscost escalations yeah what happens tothe loans that you have to pay back whathappens to the timeline that thisbusiness is going to become Revenueneutral or you're making your ends meetand there is no loss per se uh and youenter the stage where you can startmaking profit everything gets pushed Sowhen yousay you took the example of land bankalone I take it as even the attitudetowards development attitude towardseconomicbenefits and the collaterals arising outof a positive approach towards economyas as opposed to uh disruptive for wantof better word disruptiveapproach governments run in continuityeconomy has you know it's like buildinguh let us say a Dam or a mansion or ahouse or a even a small cter that youwant to build you lay the foundation andthen start doing something even as youlay the foundation if you say no I'm notlaying it for one floor above I justwant the car ground although the wholeunderstanding is you want the wholething donecompletely it affects everything thatyou think in terms of businesses soStates not just for land bank butunderstanding this principlethat governments are incontinuity and you cannot for such majorthings take a decision which iscompletely going to uh turn upside downdecisions takenearlier okay so if that is the examplethat I've taken to explain not just inland Banks but in general governmentsbeing continu in continuity you have togo ahead with some of the decisionshowever much you may disapprove of itbecause they have been already taken soif this is about decisions there's oneother point which is necessary to addhere so not only the government incontinuity economy also runs incontinuity correct unless you give itenoughleeway you cannot change a decision youcan always now pit a question against meor on me to answer saying after allIndia has been a socialist economy allthese years uh we've had public sectorundertakings we've we've had a lot ofinvestment in running big companies bygovernment of India why would you theretherefore because going by that economyis a continuity government is a Contincontinuity argument why would you wantto go ahead withprivatization in2021 I'm glad to say I was part of thisgovernment when we took a call on publicsector Enterprises policywhereby we said it cannot any longer bethe prerogative of government alone tobe in one area of business every area ofbusiness should be available for privatesector also to bein all right government will have to bein some sectors which are strategicallyimportant for us one example of that iscommunication and unless you uh havegovernment services in these uh sectorscommunication is one example you willnot be able to reach the Border areasprovide Telecom facilities there becausethe private sector would say that areadoesn't give me enough profit so I won'tgo there you need thereforestrategically there can be three or fourareas and we said that that'll be aboutonly that much where the government willalso have to bepresent it cannot be only governmentwill be present we want the efficiencyof the private sector so we opened it upnow therefore even for that 1991 isclaimed to be the time when we hadopening up of the Indian economy yeahbut even then this privatization pointwas not really worked upon it had totake its own time but government herenow under Prime Minister Modi said it'shigh time we have to open this upand look at the result it has born spacesector a bus with private interestinvestment private uh Talent uh youngpeople wanting to do a lot of work inlaunching so satellites either in thelower orbit or even the higher it hasbrought in such a lot ofsynergy that India even as it was wasstanding um as a leader in economydriven spacelaunches now it's even more efficientyou're able to send the smallestsatellite to the lowest orbit and send asatellite which is just going to monitoryour land resources your water thegroundwater table and so on so youreally made that sector vibrant so thatis the kind of change even as youemphasize on continuity very interestingma'am so you're saying that governmentshould always take the front seat andpolitics should be at at the back seat Iwould say governance when it comes toquestions of governance when it comes tothe question of economy which is goingto benefit everybody the politics cannotbe so disruptive forinstanceum the UPAgovernment brought in what wasnotoriously called retrospectivetaxationit started to tax for years longbefore and called it a correctionrelated measure they had to take it backand ask people to pay up tax for periodswhich were long gone although at thattime in their business model they wouldhave calculated the tax that they haveto pay to the government per thatprevailing rate at that time but 10years forward you bring in a law whichsays a certain tax will have to be paidgoing backward in time businesses andtheir business model can no longer takethat on because theyve costed themselvesin such a way correct that for tax thismuch is given for dividend this much isgiven if profit is earned or else thecost of a product that you they producewould be this much is all predeterminedand based on that the business happenedGoods of bought and sold and everythingnow when you're bringing in aretrospective tax who collects it fromwhom can they go back to searching eachof the product uh consumer correct so sowhen I tell you this example of goingbackwards is always disruptive so you'retalking about governance which is goingto take the back seat and which is goingto take the front seat is governancegoing to take the front seat andpolitics the one behind I wouldn't lookat it like that I look at it as so longas you're not disruptive and you'retaking it Forward governance andpolitics go hand inand but the momentyou decide that you have a differentagenda then not just going forward andgiving the benefit to the people who aredoing business and the citizens who arebenefiting from business you bound todisrupt itnegatively very very interesting ma'amma'am the next question that I haveactually comes from a very interestingchart which was put forth by a VC firmcalled Bloom Ventures and theybifurcated the income tax payers inIndia and this chart says that out ofthe 1.4 billion people 74 million peoplefiled for taxes and only 22 millionpeople were actual taxpayers so only1.5% of India's population is thetaxpaying population whereas for Chinathis is 10% and in the US it is 43% mawhy is our tax base so smalluh yes it is small and the attempt is tomake itwider but taxation is such a matter thatyou really can't impose you'll have tofind out where that Revenue lies so thatyou gradually bring them on board to sayyou should also be play paying the taxand uh therefore in India particularlyit takesa very interesting dimension in that aslong as you are earning more you andyour family are happy yeah but themoment you are under the tax net youthink the government is regressivecorrect there is a moral issue here andtherefore it will have to take its timehow do we solve this problem ma'am nudgethe people is the only solution you haveto bring in Civic Consciousness butabove all I think there's also anargument which the taxpayer has in hismind mind and I think I would uh respectthat and that thought is look what do weget for the tax that we pay exactly uhthis has been a question I think now for50 years correct because the tax paythings my road doesn't improve uh Idon't get proper drinking water in myhouse yeah three phas electricity alsowas something very aspirational yeah andthen going to a prop for hospital was abig thing private sector probably showedthe way saying better quality medicalattention is available but governmenthospitals were not really up to it soyou thought even if you were paying only100 rupees towards tax you thought my100 rupees is important for me and trulyit is important for everybody but inthat 100 rupees I don't seem to getanything better no value for money sothat anxiety still holds although PrimeMinister Modi I would gener ly credithim for one thing every rupee of thetaxpayersmoney he is clear that he has tosafeguard he's clear that that cannot befrittered away he's also clear that likethe way you know Once Upon a Time primeminister Rajiv Gandhi said if I send onerupee to the beneficiary he ends upgetting only 15 PESA correct the restare all gone away so by adoptingtechnology Prime Ministers ensured thatthat kind of leakage doesn't happen onerupe sent is one rupe received so you'resaying that once you start providingvalue for money to the people of Indiathey will they will understand theimportance of paying taxes or they'll atleast value the fact that the governmentis giving them something in return forthe tax that they're paying ma'am thisstat itself has another underlyingInsight it says that out of the 22million people who pay taxes also only4.5 million as in just 0.3% % of ourpopulation pays 80% of our taxes ma'amthis indicates a very big gap betweenthe rich and the poor and I looked atthe consumption levels and even there Ifound some stats which were quitesurprising it says that the top 1% ofIndia accounted for 45% of all flights1% of Indians took home 22% of India'sincome and just 6.5% of the users wereresponsible for 44% of all UPItransactions M why is the gap betweenthe rich and the poor increasing so muchsee I wouldn't want to play it up as theGap uh increasing so much or whatever Ithink thereis a clear disconnectbetween the qualifications that youacquire the education levels that wereach and the kind of jobs that areavailable and alsoequally jobs and the skill sets thatthey require don't seem to matter in thehigher education centers correct so I'veheard big companies tell methat a properly qualifiedengineer isrecruited but almost 6 months goes awayin making him job fit correctit's an investment for the company andwhy should they have to do it so thequalifications with which people readythemselves to face a job are still notreally up to the industry'srequirement and many companiesparticularly the medium and small onescan't even afford to you know invest intraining them because after 6 months oftraining God knows where he'll gocorrectso the concentations for industry areall now becoming so difficult that youthwho think that they come out ofuniversities are ready for jobs areunable to digest the fact that probablythey are just not ready for jobs yet butso is this a government observation andis this something which I'm going toleave it as it is it's for them to faceno we are trying to bridge this Gap weare trying to work with industry groupsto say why don't you you tell us what isthe kind of requirement you have and inthe curriculum that is being impartedwould you want to join hands at least inthe last one year at least in the lasttwo years of an engineering course andsay look give him such skills which arerequired for a forging company metalforging company or if it's an automobileshop flow what would he want him to do Iknow there are institutions like thepower toolsuh Corporation of power tools Instituteor something government of India runokay which trains mechanical engineerswhich trains people how to go aboutusing instruments and be of you knowrelevance in the shop flow but many moresuch are required not for just theengineering now the PM vishwakarma ythat we've come up with okay is the onewhich says for people who are workingwith some bare minimum toolsin other words working essentially withtheir hands but probably using a minimumset of tools they shall be propertraining given they will be given a kindof a stifen during the course post whicha 15,000 rupees worth of Kit will beprovided to them okay and with thatcertification today they can qualify formany of these big ticket jobs orassignments or contracts or subsubcontract RS and so on so yeah theseare serious problems of people withinadequate skill sets aspiring forjobs Ma I was reading something calledthe skill India report and what youmentioned is great for the bottom of thepyramid but what I'm deeply concernedabout is the middle of the pyramid ma'ambecause this skill India report saysthat just give me asecond now the skill India report saysthat more than 35% of of our btechstudents are unemployable 30% of our MBAstudents are unemployable 60% of ouritti students are unemployable and morethan 75% of our poly Technic studentsare unemployable so and you know ma'am Ihave been the perfect witness to thisentire transition because 10 years backI was in college and I am that studentthat you're talking about who thoughtafter college I'll find a great job butby the end of college I realize that Ido not know anything that is relevant tothe industry today and 10 years laternow I'm recruiting engineers and I'msaying the same problem M they'rereading out of outdated textbooksthey're reading outdated Concepts andthey do not know anything that isrelevant for today's industry so ma'amhow are we solving this problem for themiddle of the pyramid which is ourengineers and management students atleast you've uh put your example forwardfirst thing I think and this is not tosay it's it's not part of government'sownresponsibility the drive that anindividual has to recogrecognize that this is not going to workout for him and he has to find adifferent thing as I say get your mojoback how do you get your mojo back onceyou identify that you don't seem to haveyour mojo in a particular area and ifyou have to acquire it what is it thatyou have to do and once you identifythere are now online or offline coursesavailable for you to be able to equipyour self better that is one and secondpeer group learning is something which Ithink till my college days we've all allbenefited from today the world is sofast we think my each of our mobileswill be are peers no way yeah peers arethose who will be able to sit with youand put you the context in which you'llhave to search for what is missing inyou those kind of interactions are nowbecoming very few and far between that'sa second and a third it is true youquoted the I I unfortunately are withthe state governments many stategovernments in the last 30 40 years havestopped investing in them why do youneed to invest in them upgrade the toolsbring in new world tools with whichyou'll train the young person and uh notjust in the same repeated uh skillsthere are newer areas in which we wantpeople to come take the example of todaythe expansion in renewable energyparticularly solar who are the youngpeople who are laying the panels who aresetting the panels to a certain anglefacing the sun who are those peoplethey're not highend skilled workerswhere did they acquire and today the tomeet the ever growing demand of solarenergy you have people who are servicingit you have people who understand howthe film has to be you know maintainedcleaned and how it has got to be placedand so on so thatsector has found itself having to adjustvery quickly to changingrequirements similarly for other sectorstoo we need both the state and thecentral government together with privatesector joining hand to say I need goodtrained Workforce or else I'm not goingto be able to fill the Gap that's whathappened during thecovid I've been in touch with most ofthe industry during covid when it wasall shut up to make sure that theworkers go back to where they want to goback that they are not facing anyhardship and so on similarly after thelockdown waslifted I was in touch with them again tosay are they coming back you would besurprised to hear that many of them whobooked the air tickets and got theseworkers earlier through some middleperson were told no sorry we are notcoming back why because these workersfound better bargaining okay with otherareas so they were able to choose to goto a different company or with theskills that they acquired they thoughtthey'll be able to do something of theirown in their own neighborhoods in TheVillages I heard at least two largeindustrialist tell me and they belong tothe South they said um well I'm notgetting the same people who I hadtrained over the last several years I'mgoing to have to invest to get newerfellows and train them but well now I'verealized that how much of you do itmight be better off for you to get localfellows and train them so many of theSouthern districts of Tamil Nadu alsowhich face uh labor related problemsbecause they don't have enoughopportunities were picked up and theywere trained and even they had adifferent level of satisfaction becausenow they're very closer to home they'rewilling to work so such reset in thelabor market is happening postco soma'am you're saying that the center andthe state need to again coordinate onthis and make sure that there's anindustry academic connect such that thedemand and Supply both are matched rightnow the one question that I had thenwhich had worked initially very wellprob continues to work in the domain ofstartups where we brought in thesestartups to join hands with the uh thehubs which were set up in IIT likeplaces Indian Institute of Sciences likeplaces people came there sat with themand they help them to understand wherethe problem is and where the solutionshave have got to come and it has becomea big catalytic Center these hubs M theone question that had and this is purelyout of curiosity is that why don't wejust put a restriction on the number ofengineering colleges that are opening upbecause ma'am to be honest in Pune thereare colleges that are being set upmerely for the sake of making money andthe professors are incompetent they arejust great with marketing and thesestudents and parents who come from faraway Villages they come to thesecolleges and then there is a there's asales team which convinces them andsells them dreams that you know we'll beable to get you a 4.5 lakh package we'llbe able to get you a .5 lakh package andeventually after 4 years after takingeducation loan also these people are notable to find jobs and this pointstowards a larger problem also becausetoday if we say that you know we have1.3 million Engineers coming out to aforeign investor this seems like a goldmine because if 1.3 million Engineersare coming out every year that is greatplus a labor cost are low but when thatperson comes over here and actually seesthe quality of our engineers and he seesthat most of our Engineers are notengineers at all that that number onedents the reputation of the country andnumber two all of these engineeringcolleges are not engineering colleges atall they're just engineering collegesfor the name sake so again with thecenter State coordination do we havesomething by which we can curb theexpansion of these engineeringinstitutes in such a way that whateverSupply we have we have concrete supplyand the rest of the people can just findsomething else to do rather than beingdeceived by these engineering collegesin the name of great packages absolutelya very very critical question and anissue which is definitely a festeringissue many of them who borrow money andaim to have their children go high intheir lives have been shattered yeah andquality lessinfrastructure uh facultyless programs have actually hurt thesector I know the example that you citedof is also applicable in many parts ofSouthern States many engineeringcolleges are just lying there correctlike huge concrete monsters with nothingin it true there has to certainly be alot more vigilance in this matter andlot more compliance of Standards okayma'am ma'am the next question that Ihave is about GST and ma'am GST withouta doubt has been a phenomenal successbecause my Chacha G is extremely enviousof us because we don't have to face thesame problems that he did during thattime and all the stakeholders that Ispoke to in fact we made a video on GSTand we asked people to comment as abusiness owner whether they were happywith GST or not and most of the peoplesaid yes but there's one category ofstakeholder who's particularly not happyabout GST and those other stategovernments like Tamil Nadu and Kela manbefore that I just want to set thepremise for this just so that I have theunderstanding of how GST operatesproperly if a t-shirt worth 100 rupeesis produced in Tamil Nadu and it is soldin a state like up and if 20 rupees GSTis collected on this t-shirt 10 Rupeesgoes to the center and 10 Rupees goes tothe state right and out of this 10 rupethat goes to the state it goes to theconsumer state which is up and nonproducer state which is Tamil Nadu rightgovernments like Tamil Nadu often arguethat we've invested thousands of Crowesinto setting up factories buildinghighways then why is it that our benefitof producing the goods are being passedon to other states where there are justmore number of people out there to justconsume the goods so ma'am how do youMa'am why don't we just split I knowthis is a very amateur question ma'amand I know that there are complexcalculations in place but why don't wejust split the GST between the producerState and the consumer Stateequally how would that work out afterthe 20 rupes that is collected 10 rupesgoes to the center 5 rupees goes to theproducer State and 5 rupees goes to theconsumer State wouldn't that be enoughto in a way isn't isn't that what isworking because you how do you knowwhich product will be consumed to whatextent in a particular State M maybesome states consume more of M let's sayjary products some other states Mayconsume a lot moreof Metal Goods so for item wise I'llhave to and some other states Mayconsume one item this month and maybenot the nextmonth so you can't have a thumb Rule anddo it it has to be on actual buying andselling that is why this complex systemwas bought simply saying how much getsso so in a particular State and that iswhy when GST was launched in2017 manufacturing states were allunhappy saying I lose my advantage I gotso many Industries to come to my placeset up the business now are you saying Iwon't get my share no they werecompensated for it so that they theycome come on board saying okaymanufacturing States will be givensomething you know and they agreed tosome kind of a settlement because nowthe emphasis or the principle ofTaxation moves on to the consumer youtake that measure okay ma'am so afterthis compensation is now applicable till2026 right the GST compensation no it'sover it was till 2022 and then it's overyes it's over okay what you're gettingtill 26 is the compensation tax getscollected okay it goes towards thepayment of the principle and theinterest on the borrowings that we didokay during the lockdown when nothingmoved no GST revenues were generated butstill States had to be given moneybecause how will they run otherwisecorrect so money was borrowed and givento states on the understanding that itwill have to be paid back by thecompensation cess that we use okay andthat compensation says was thereforeextended Beyond22 strictly only to pay thecompensations due that was to be paidassume okay that during the lockdown ifeverything was normal no lockdown youwould have earned as much as you gave aswell correct without earning your givingbecause you borrowed that borrowing hasto be paid from where it has to be paidfrom the same cess that gets collectedso although till 22 we gave it to theStates now having extended it till till26 the collected money goes only forpaying the borrowed amount okay and it'sservicing of the interest Okay so until2022 they were compensated but after2022 till2026 whatever the state gave to thecenter during the times of covid no nono what about the GST Council borrowedto pay the states okay and that is nowbeing collected in the form of the samecess is getting collected till 26 okayand the collected cess between 22 and 26goes for paying that borrowed amountwhich the GST Council borrowed to paythe state's the compensation says okayduring the lockdown see between 272017 and2022 states were given a 14%compensation okay meaning every statebased on the20156 base year would be growing at aparticular level level each state grewat at its own level based on the trendof the earliercollection but the GST at the time oflaunching agreed that it will be assumedthat all states will grow in say at a14% level now if you actually grew onlyat 10% level hardly any state grew at 10but many of them grew at seven or 8%best performers the others perform lessbetter whatever be itso if you actually grew at only 7 or8% the rest s or 6% would be given toyou by the compensation cess which waslevied on extra luxurious or sinfulGoods okay okay so that money wascollected in the name of compensationcess and that was used to give thedifferen sh between actually whatRevenue was earned and the protectedRevenue which is 14% will be beguaranteed to every state so between 14and 7 The Gap was paid through thecompensation cess okay but that was onlyup to22 and in the covid year because wecouldn't collect anything we borrowedmoney and kept that promiseup all right so who's going to pay theborrowedmoney after 22 we extended thecollection and with that money we arepaying back the borrowed moneyunderstood ma'am ma'am this is very veryclear to usbecause um from the mainstream mediawhat I understood is that there arestates like Tamil Nadu which wereprotesting because they were saying thatit's like penalizing the states forinvesting so much money into buildingfactories when there are states that arejust consuming things is not buildingfactories what are you saying no they'resaying is that we spent we put in somuch efforts and thousand of Cl intobuilding highways but um all of ourefforts are being penalized because ourrevenu is going to the consumer statethat was the narrative so I just wantedto ask you that question okay ma' thenext question that I have is about thisagain north south divide that's outthere and I want you to clarify thisjust like you did forGST and this is coming from thedivisible pool of taxes by the way guysuh for those who don't know this is justfor the audience if the center collects1,000 crores 41% of it in 2024 goes toall the states so 1.8% might go toKerala 6% will go to Maharashtra and soon and so forth and the financecommission decides which state will gethow muchpercent and this pool right now is about12 lakh crores right ma'am is thatcorrect okay ma'am here's where theFinance Minister of Kerala Ken balgopalargues he says that Kera gets only 21Rupees against every 100 rupe that Keracollects but for up this number is 46out of 100 and for Bihar it'sdrastically High Bihar gets 70 rupeesout of the 100 rupe that it collects andhere's where the north south dividenarrative comes into play ma'am so ma'amwhat is the logic behind dividing thispool of money between different statesand why is there such a drasticdifference first of all I think thisnarrativeis somewhat distorted okay I'm notcoming into saying the numbers aredistorted I'm not even I'm saying theprinciple on the basis of which this isbeing put out is absolutely distortedokay I'll start from an example and I'llelaboratelet's take Kerala let's take Tamil Nadulet's takeKarnataka if actually the total amountof Revenue or taxation that you pay isthe principle on the basis of which taxhas to be given back to you koi inKerala would take away everything thatis collected yeah all right coochi whichbenefits from having one of the world'sbest portswhich is a national port in whichgovernment of India's money goes in thatPort is built maintain run modernized upkeep everything is with thecenter look at the way in whichcomplexity gets into the argument yeahall right now Ki therefore also has aairport to which the central civilaviation Ministry spends a thought okayKi also has one of the biggest centersofNavy for which central governmentexclusively spends money now all of themhave a ripple effect on the economy Kicorrectright but even after that if KeralaRepresentatives say Ki gives so much taxare you first of all excluding these bigtietInvestments which are giving the rippleeffect for the Kieconomy and pretending that everythingthat which is happening in kuchi is madeout of kerala's ownmoney so it starts with a bit of anillogic there okaysecond if koi alone is able to generatesomuch what happens to canor what happensto tiur what happens to further uphod what happens toPanAm are we thensing everything that koochi gives Kochigets back be damned with the rest of thedistricts so in the case of TamilNadu everything which happens in Chennaior kambur goes back to Chennai and katurbe done with veur of the world um umperambalur of the world forgetramapuram would you say that no youcan't do anything inarur so come similarly to Karnataka yourchitra yourB raichur Yad will all be left becauseevery money will have to be going backtoBangalore so what are we trying toconvey I'm not even getting to talkingabout you know we give one rupe we getonly 25 PESA no I'm not even coming tothat first of all as I took the Kiexample I'll take Bangaloreexample how many Industries in KKarnataka and also in bangaluru ormangaluru are funded by thecenter leave all that the Common ManTravels bytrain is the Karnataka leg of the trainbeing funded by Karnataka governmentcentral government funds it A to B B toC C toZ Railways are fully with similarly AirForce bangaluru has one of the Air Forcebig centers Army Headquarters there oneof the Southern division isthere are there not monies coming fromthe center yeah so I want this wholething to be placed in its proper contextand again throwing it as though it isprime minister modi's government whichdecides on these rates is a deliberateattempt to mislead after all people weresitting in governance holdingresponsible constitutional positions dorealize that these are not percentagesdecided by prime minister or thegovernment of India there is aconstitutional body called the financecommission that decidesit so when that next commission comeswhich is already constituted the 16thmeet them and tell put your casesforward now what are the most importantparameters that the finance commissionconsiders while Distributing this moneyfrom the divisible pool a few thingsremain throughout and a few others keepchanging being brought in and so on andI know the one solid argument which thesouthern states would put in is aboutpopulation yeah uh also put aboutschools and colleges and medicalfacilities and so on but whatever beit the arguments will have to be put tothe consideration of the financecommission and once the financecommission decides on the rates we haveto follow it so population is oneparameter m'am any other major I thinkeducation climateresilience many other many other thingsso obviously when you talk of statesgstp and the population it'll all fallin place okay because here's where againKerala brings another argument right nowK is facing an economic crisis and Ijust did some math and they said thatyou know from the 10th Financecommission to the 15th Financecommission our share in the divisiblepool has decreased from 3.8% to 1.9%that yeah I want to say yeah I want tosay even before you completeyour for till the Constitution andcompletion of the work of the 14thFinancecommission 14th Finance commission'sreport was submitted in 2014 first thingwhich after the Prime Minister tookcharge in 2014 14th Finance commission'sreport came okay so till then beginningthe 10th till the14th mostly it was the UPA governmentokay mostly in in most of these UPACongress L UPA governments Kerala hashad at least five or more ministerssittingthere other than the Kerala governgovernment themselves couldn't theministers in the Kerala I mean inCongress L UPA ministers who came fromCongress tell their own governmentsaying please go back to the financecommission kerala's revenue is comingdown to pick it up now and throw it atus 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th theythemselves are saying right yeah fromthe 10th to 14th it's all been fallingit was allyours because ma'am the argument iscoming right now and is becoming morerelevant because right now they'refacing an economic crisis and I try tounderstand the gravity of this argumentso 3.8% I mean I'm sorry to interruptagain tosay Revenue falling may be one of theproblems your own State's efficiency incollecting revenues what is the problemover there ma'am why is it so I'm askingI'm asking this as a question okay whynot look at your own State's resourcesthat you collect be more efficient bringin more elements into into it andalso the borrowing on which they went tothe court to the Supreme Court I'masking budgetary borrowingextrabudgetaryborrowing please account for all of themin the assembly where electedrepresentatives of caralasitting you don't talk about theborrowing which has been extra budgetaryand continuing at some level tillnow whereas you have a problem withRevenue falling this if the centralshare is falling I'm also asking everystate has its own way of improving theirown collection their own State's ownresources understood ma'am so you'resaying that disil pool is not apractical solution they have to managetheir economic also one of the thingsthey have to give their own attentionmany states have shown rapid changes inthe way in which they brought in morecreative ways of Revenue generation okayfor example ma'am uh look at the waystamp Duty has been handled okayMaharashtra for instance during covidrealized that unless they were going tochange their approach towards stamp Dutythe inventory which was sitting in realestate meaning built propertieshousing will languish and they changethe rate and what a difference itmade they collected more Revenue theinventory with all the builders wascleared now there's fresh demand formore housing that is one of the ways todo it the other way to do it there arestill some items which are exclusivelyleft to thestates in that are you efficient I'm notasking for a increase in tax becausebecause I know there is this temptationpeople will immediately say that ohshe's suggesting increasing tax no I'mnot saying that efficient tax collectionefficient tax collection plugloopholes make sure that you're usingTechnologies to understand where evationis happening loophole is one thingevasion isanother you know there can be people whoare completely avoiding paying taxesfinding out ways in which they can skipthe net correct are we proving all thatma'am you have done a phenomenal jobwith GST because the number of taxpayers is increasing the amount of taxcollected is increasing and you broughtin some revolutionary policies to maketax collection more efficient so ma'amhow did you do it uh by first of all Imust say the Readiness to adopttechnology and to deploy technology tomake it simple is something which primeminister has done in Gujarat okay he hasprime minister now as chief minister inGujarat and as prime minister nowcontinuously kept us pushing saying canyou not bring in technology to assesswhere it goes how it gets collected canyou not see using you know artificialintelligence where you can trace themoney and where loopholes are happeningor where wrong hands are receiving letus say the refund that you're paying orfalse claims being laid saying I'veexported so much give me some money backwhere actual export has not happenedonly paper you know shuffling ishappened so using technology for thepurposes of better Revenue collectionhas actually given us good resultsotherwise you will be fishing or as yousay in Technology based languageinternet B based language fishingExpedition would be going on you'll beyou know doing a wild goose chase whatwe are doing now is when you do with theAI you're able to get the entire spidersweb as it were so one leads to anotherthird leads to the fourth fourth leadsto something else so you touch oneyou're able to touch everybody else sothe whole web just falls apart ma'am canyou give me one example ofthis one example of this was in theinput tax credit okay in theGST you get the creditor if there is an inversion you get therefund back okay in suchcases where there's no transactionhappening but bills are being shown youended up having to base the bill pay thepeople okay but the bills are only paperwork like even in the toll tax which wasmoving a truck would move up and downtwo or three times with no stuff in itoh okay and the claim would be thistruck went four times and therefore youhave to pay us to that extent okay withno Mal was transported okay that came tolight because U particularly becauseGujarat and utar Pradesh both came upsaying something is Hanky Panky herewe'll have to check it up how did theyidentify that ma'am one truck the sametruck registration number how many timeswill he go within a matter of 48 hoursin two different distances which aremore than 300 km each I'm saying roughlyokay so then they got Noy about thewhole thing and when they when theyactually went in to find out they got toknow it ma'am this almost looks like aNetflix documentary that's right most ofthe Customs related and GST relatedmatters are all coming up because ofthese kind of mild deficiencies whichofficers say you know they detectsomething and then they're curious theywant to tie tie up the Los ends they endup seeing a big problemand Technology helps them today insteadof having to you know spend hourssearching for where it goes who's thefellow ultimately receives it becausemoney Trail is so quickly establishedthis is almost like an fmcg companytrying to find out leakage that isexcellent ma'am ma'am one lastquestion if your government comes topower what is your vision for India from2024 to 2029 ma'am I think broadly it'svery well laidout first of all get to the threeuh third largest economy okay within ayear and a half or two okay unless youknow something Black Swan we don't knowbut otherwise we should be able to okayand work towards 2047 viit Barat andprimary use of doing business for thatyes and to make sure that manufacturingmake in India atbar bat all go hand inhand you already have a service sectorwhich is contributing more than 60% toour G GDP P you already have anagriculture sector where there's a lotof activity today to export and give thefarmer better Returns on his producebecause exporting abroad he gets moneyin foreign exchange that gives himbetter yield assurance that his productswill be sold at that price and so on sothe comfort of export will have to alsobe extended but of course because inIndia we can't be indifferent to theprices at which product will be sold theconsumer end of agricultural products isalso important Farmers important theother end the consumer is important soeverything going for export is going tomake it too expensive and probably Goodswill not be available for Indianconsumers correct so we'll have to finda balance there for agriculture andManufacturing as I said so balance foragriculture manufacturing isas of doingbusiness eventually leading us to thethird largest economy and the vision of2047 is that correct ma'am thank you somuch ma'am thank you so much so much forbeing so patient with all of youranswers especially for giving examplesbecause I was able to understandeverything I just hope everybody elsedid thank you so much ma'am it was apleasure to have you thank you very muchthank you so much[Music]

Video script when it comes to the question of economywhich is going to benefit everybody thepolitics cannot be so disrupt Once Upona Time prime minister Rajiv Gandhi saidif I send one rupee to the beneficiaryhe ends up getting only 15 P adoptingtechnology Prime Ministers ensured thatthat kind of leakage doesn't happen onerup sent is one Rupee received one ofthe most crucial Ministries in Mod'scabinet the Ministry of Finance has beenENT trusted to Nala sitaraman she's oneof the top ministers in the governmentof India so only 1.5% of India'spopulation is the taxpaying populationwhereas for China this is 10% and in theUS it is 43% M why is our tax base sosmall as long as you are earning moreyou and your family are happy but themoment you are under the tax net youthink the government is regressive thereare states like Tamil Nadu which wereprotesting because they were saying thatit's like penalizing the states forinvesting so much money into buildingfactories when there are states that arejust consuming things is not buildingfactories what are you saying the top 1%of India accounted for 45% of allflights and just 6.5% of the users wereresponsible for 44% of all UPItransactions man why is the gap betweenthe rich and the poor increasing so muchman the skill India report says thatmore than 35% of our btech students areunemployable 30% of our MBA students areunemployable 60% of our it students areun unemployable and more than 75% of ourPolytechnic students are unemployablethe Finance Minister of Kerala Kenbalgopal argues he says that Kerala getsonly 21 Rupees against every 100 rupethat Kerala collects but for up thisnumber is 46 out of 100 and for Biharit's drastically High Bihar gets 70rupes out of the 100 rupe that itcollects and here's where the northsouth divide narrative comes intoplaymap so ma'am what is the logicbehind dividing this pool of money Ithink this narrative issomewhat[Music]distorted hi everybody this is aconversation that I had with one of themost powerful women in India who is noneother than our finance minister shrimatinirmala sitaraman in this episode wespoke at length on what exactly are theobstacles that India faces while it ison its way to become a $7 trillioneconomy why is there rampantunemployment in India what is the visionthat bjb has for India and mostimportantly we spoke at length on whySouthern States like Tamil Nadu andKerala get less money from the center ascompared to northern states like up andBihar so as usual I tried my level bestto ask her as many questions as possiblein the limited time that we had we didmiss out on a lot of questions but forthe questions that we could ask nirmalamaam was kind enough to explaineverything using examples and numbers soso now it's up to you to decide whetherour answers were satisfactory or not andnow on with theepisode hello ma'am welcome to theIndian business podcast and thank you somuch for giving us such an importantslot in your valuable schedule ma'am ma'the agenda for today's podcast is verysimple we want to understand thefundamental insights of great governancewhich usually gets missed out bymainstream media and I have veryspecific questions coming straight fromthe people of India and what we seek tostand are the underlying insights behindthe functioning of the government so allthroughout this episode if you can beextremely elaborative with your answersas simple as possible and with as manyexamples as possible that would befantastic ma'am shall we get startedokay yes and thank you for having meGanesh thank you so much ma'am ma'am thefirst question that I have comes fromyour India India today conclave answerand you mentioned that a critical factorto help us become a $7 trillion economyis the coordination between the statecenter and the panchayat ma could youplease elaborate on that and help meunderstand what is this coordinationissue and how are we solving forit see as youknow the governance structure inIndia is divided bysubjects as much as it is dividedprimarily between the centralgovernment the state government and ofcourse the Third thirdlayer so there are subjects as theyrefer to which are entirely the centralgovernment'sdomain and there are subjects which areentirely the state government'sdomains and there are those which haveboth ofthem they call it as concurrent subjectswhere both the center and the stateshave a role to play so even there youknowsome aspects of that subject will bedealt by the center and some otheraspects will be done by the states andtheoverlaps are kept to the minimumoverlaps even withinconcurrent so when we refer to thesubjects those can be fantastically doneby any one Center or the state but evenin those nowadays very clearlyuh the interests of thestates need to be given a voice and insubjects which are statesexclusively even their local bodiesbecause they're also elected they alsohave aspirations they have people'sRepresentatives sitting in them so theyare answerable back to the voters so thelocal self government or the third layeras we call Urban localbodies will also have a very decisiverole to play to The Limited area inwhich they operate but offlate the one big glitch to this wholething is being felt because localgovernments are not yet into thatGroove because eventually when you takea investment to some area it is in thatpocket where they have to be locatedmany of the clearances will have toemanate from andtherefore there is a need for the localbodies to understand why they have to beeasy with people who are coming easymeaning well within therules uh make it facilitative ratherthan uh obstructive because when youthink you want to regulate them controlthem or uh bring more rules on them youthink you're having a hold but that canfrighten people away from yourplace so it is that kind of aunderstanding and participating with thesame intent that you need to have allthe layers working together that's why Ihad said that could you help meunderstand this as an example ma'am anyexample will be let ussay uh now you're having all thesesemiconductor chipmanufacturing earlier you had themaruti uh was it uh that the smallestcar Nano Nano which was going to bemanufactured and where they went thestate government and the local body didnot make it easy for them and at thatpoint in time before 2014 electiontypical of Gujarat which was bristfriendly uh they said no you come overwe'll do it and therefore leaving thearea where it was to be established inBengal Tata rushed to sanand and theGujarat government together with thelocal body there enabled within I'm told10 days the permissions requiredclearances and everything so that theycould invest now uh without looking atany ill will or malfi why wouldn't thathappen in Bengal after all the sameInvestments by Tata was going to happenthere correct that insensitivity or callit indifference affected a big Prospectof a business similar is the way inwhich you have private Indian investorsgoing in formanufacturingsemiconductors it's no good repeatingthe example Gujarat offered themfavorable anyone could have offered andthat got proven by the fact that wouldyou imagine Assam gave them theopportunity you tend to think northeaststates need a lot more pushing up toeven be at par with many of the statesso that industry can go in there butwhat did Assam do differently from manyother states which in manufacturingexcept for core Industries like cementor something you don't have any of thosenew tech technology driven areas or umit driven industry being there but theydrew them yeah and uh hardned businesshouse like tatas found it possible toestablish not a c Factory not a you knowintegrated Steel factory but a verycoed semiconductor manufacturing placeso that is the point in which the stategovernment working together with localauthorities can do what you wouldotherwise in common sense think isimpossible if they only move that fastand understanding the need two examplesvery interesting ma'am ma'am youmentioned about ease of doing businessin Gujarat and I've read this countlesstimes in fact we' made a case studio inGujarat and we often found out that alot of entrepreneurs have given astatement publicly saying that it isvery easy for us to set up our factoriesin Gujarat versus in any other state infact ran Tata G himself gave out astatement that while many other stateswere offering Tata lands it was onlyGujarat that was not just offering butalso kept the land ready and that wasbecause of the land banking system in guGujarat and why is it that we have notbeen able to scale the land bankingsystem all across the country Ma'am whyonly guat I wouldn't think uh you rightin that there are many states which wentahead with land banking system keepingcertain demarked areas ready forindustry who will come forward and so onbut what is uh the distinction betweenuh what gujarat's approaches uh asregards the others compared to Gujaratis consistently they are doing it ohokay whereas in other states take theexample of Maharashtra after all thesame bullet train was approved inMaharashtra as well to be one of theterminal points for it the otherterminal point in Gujarat and it runs uhpartly through Gujarat and comes partlythrough parts of Northern Maharashtraand reach Mumbai yeah it was approvedokay it was all cleared Japanese came ina big way both for the technology andfor building the equality that isrequired for the track Ling for the thebridges which are going to hold them andeverything else but what happened with achange of government that particularagreement or understanding was put inthe back burner so from the terminalpoint in Gujarat till almost the borderof Maharashtra the work was almost 2/3complete but they had to Halt theycouldn't come further here becauseMaharashtra changed its approach to theproject now a project like that whichinvolves overseas investors overseastechnology having agreed and a centralgovernment which is working to get theseoverseas because most of the overseasloans when they come they come to thestates for their projects but theguarantor is the centralgovernment now with all this donesuddenly when a change of governmenthappens and for you for politicalconsiderations you say it's not requiredfor me the impact it has on the overalluh approach to making investment inIndia attractive just Falls flat allright then again with a change ofgovernment that's getting restored allright okay now what happens to theoverall completion of project it getsdelay what happens to that portion ofthe project which got delayed and itscost escalations yeah what happens tothe loans that you have to pay back whathappens to the timeline that thisbusiness is going to become Revenueneutral or you're making your ends meetand there is no loss per se uh and youenter the stage where you can startmaking profit everything gets pushed Sowhen yousay you took the example of land bankalone I take it as even the attitudetowards development attitude towardseconomicbenefits and the collaterals arising outof a positive approach towards economyas as opposed to uh disruptive for wantof better word disruptiveapproach governments run in continuityeconomy has you know it's like buildinguh let us say a Dam or a mansion or ahouse or a even a small cter that youwant to build you lay the foundation andthen start doing something even as youlay the foundation if you say no I'm notlaying it for one floor above I justwant the car ground although the wholeunderstanding is you want the wholething donecompletely it affects everything thatyou think in terms of businesses soStates not just for land bank butunderstanding this principlethat governments are incontinuity and you cannot for such majorthings take a decision which iscompletely going to uh turn upside downdecisions takenearlier okay so if that is the examplethat I've taken to explain not just inland Banks but in general governmentsbeing continu in continuity you have togo ahead with some of the decisionshowever much you may disapprove of itbecause they have been already taken soif this is about decisions there's oneother point which is necessary to addhere so not only the government incontinuity economy also runs incontinuity correct unless you give itenoughleeway you cannot change a decision youcan always now pit a question against meor on me to answer saying after allIndia has been a socialist economy allthese years uh we've had public sectorundertakings we've we've had a lot ofinvestment in running big companies bygovernment of India why would you theretherefore because going by that economyis a continuity government is a Contincontinuity argument why would you wantto go ahead withprivatization in2021 I'm glad to say I was part of thisgovernment when we took a call on publicsector Enterprises policywhereby we said it cannot any longer bethe prerogative of government alone tobe in one area of business every area ofbusiness should be available for privatesector also to bein all right government will have to bein some sectors which are strategicallyimportant for us one example of that iscommunication and unless you uh havegovernment services in these uh sectorscommunication is one example you willnot be able to reach the Border areasprovide Telecom facilities there becausethe private sector would say that areadoesn't give me enough profit so I won'tgo there you need thereforestrategically there can be three or fourareas and we said that that'll be aboutonly that much where the government willalso have to bepresent it cannot be only governmentwill be present we want the efficiencyof the private sector so we opened it upnow therefore even for that 1991 isclaimed to be the time when we hadopening up of the Indian economy yeahbut even then this privatization pointwas not really worked upon it had totake its own time but government herenow under Prime Minister Modi said it'shigh time we have to open this upand look at the result it has born spacesector a bus with private interestinvestment private uh Talent uh youngpeople wanting to do a lot of work inlaunching so satellites either in thelower orbit or even the higher it hasbrought in such a lot ofsynergy that India even as it was wasstanding um as a leader in economydriven spacelaunches now it's even more efficientyou're able to send the smallestsatellite to the lowest orbit and send asatellite which is just going to monitoryour land resources your water thegroundwater table and so on so youreally made that sector vibrant so thatis the kind of change even as youemphasize on continuity very interestingma'am so you're saying that governmentshould always take the front seat andpolitics should be at at the back seat Iwould say governance when it comes toquestions of governance when it comes tothe question of economy which is goingto benefit everybody the politics cannotbe so disruptive forinstanceum the UPAgovernment brought in what wasnotoriously called retrospectivetaxationit started to tax for years longbefore and called it a correctionrelated measure they had to take it backand ask people to pay up tax for periodswhich were long gone although at thattime in their business model they wouldhave calculated the tax that they haveto pay to the government per thatprevailing rate at that time but 10years forward you bring in a law whichsays a certain tax will have to be paidgoing backward in time businesses andtheir business model can no longer takethat on because theyve costed themselvesin such a way correct that for tax thismuch is given for dividend this much isgiven if profit is earned or else thecost of a product that you they producewould be this much is all predeterminedand based on that the business happenedGoods of bought and sold and everythingnow when you're bringing in aretrospective tax who collects it fromwhom can they go back to searching eachof the product uh consumer correct so sowhen I tell you this example of goingbackwards is always disruptive so you'retalking about governance which is goingto take the back seat and which is goingto take the front seat is governancegoing to take the front seat andpolitics the one behind I wouldn't lookat it like that I look at it as so longas you're not disruptive and you'retaking it Forward governance andpolitics go hand inand but the momentyou decide that you have a differentagenda then not just going forward andgiving the benefit to the people who aredoing business and the citizens who arebenefiting from business you bound todisrupt itnegatively very very interesting ma'amma'am the next question that I haveactually comes from a very interestingchart which was put forth by a VC firmcalled Bloom Ventures and theybifurcated the income tax payers inIndia and this chart says that out ofthe 1.4 billion people 74 million peoplefiled for taxes and only 22 millionpeople were actual taxpayers so only1.5% of India's population is thetaxpaying population whereas for Chinathis is 10% and in the US it is 43% mawhy is our tax base so smalluh yes it is small and the attempt is tomake itwider but taxation is such a matter thatyou really can't impose you'll have tofind out where that Revenue lies so thatyou gradually bring them on board to sayyou should also be play paying the taxand uh therefore in India particularlyit takesa very interesting dimension in that aslong as you are earning more you andyour family are happy yeah but themoment you are under the tax net youthink the government is regressivecorrect there is a moral issue here andtherefore it will have to take its timehow do we solve this problem ma'am nudgethe people is the only solution you haveto bring in Civic Consciousness butabove all I think there's also anargument which the taxpayer has in hismind mind and I think I would uh respectthat and that thought is look what do weget for the tax that we pay exactly uhthis has been a question I think now for50 years correct because the tax paythings my road doesn't improve uh Idon't get proper drinking water in myhouse yeah three phas electricity alsowas something very aspirational yeah andthen going to a prop for hospital was abig thing private sector probably showedthe way saying better quality medicalattention is available but governmenthospitals were not really up to it soyou thought even if you were paying only100 rupees towards tax you thought my100 rupees is important for me and trulyit is important for everybody but inthat 100 rupees I don't seem to getanything better no value for money sothat anxiety still holds although PrimeMinister Modi I would gener ly credithim for one thing every rupee of thetaxpayersmoney he is clear that he has tosafeguard he's clear that that cannot befrittered away he's also clear that likethe way you know Once Upon a Time primeminister Rajiv Gandhi said if I send onerupee to the beneficiary he ends upgetting only 15 PESA correct the restare all gone away so by adoptingtechnology Prime Ministers ensured thatthat kind of leakage doesn't happen onerupe sent is one rupe received so you'resaying that once you start providingvalue for money to the people of Indiathey will they will understand theimportance of paying taxes or they'll atleast value the fact that the governmentis giving them something in return forthe tax that they're paying ma'am thisstat itself has another underlyingInsight it says that out of the 22million people who pay taxes also only4.5 million as in just 0.3% % of ourpopulation pays 80% of our taxes ma'amthis indicates a very big gap betweenthe rich and the poor and I looked atthe consumption levels and even there Ifound some stats which were quitesurprising it says that the top 1% ofIndia accounted for 45% of all flights1% of Indians took home 22% of India'sincome and just 6.5% of the users wereresponsible for 44% of all UPItransactions M why is the gap betweenthe rich and the poor increasing so muchsee I wouldn't want to play it up as theGap uh increasing so much or whatever Ithink thereis a clear disconnectbetween the qualifications that youacquire the education levels that wereach and the kind of jobs that areavailable and alsoequally jobs and the skill sets thatthey require don't seem to matter in thehigher education centers correct so I'veheard big companies tell methat a properly qualifiedengineer isrecruited but almost 6 months goes awayin making him job fit correctit's an investment for the company andwhy should they have to do it so thequalifications with which people readythemselves to face a job are still notreally up to the industry'srequirement and many companiesparticularly the medium and small onescan't even afford to you know invest intraining them because after 6 months oftraining God knows where he'll gocorrectso the concentations for industry areall now becoming so difficult that youthwho think that they come out ofuniversities are ready for jobs areunable to digest the fact that probablythey are just not ready for jobs yet butso is this a government observation andis this something which I'm going toleave it as it is it's for them to faceno we are trying to bridge this Gap weare trying to work with industry groupsto say why don't you you tell us what isthe kind of requirement you have and inthe curriculum that is being impartedwould you want to join hands at least inthe last one year at least in the lasttwo years of an engineering course andsay look give him such skills which arerequired for a forging company metalforging company or if it's an automobileshop flow what would he want him to do Iknow there are institutions like thepower toolsuh Corporation of power tools Instituteor something government of India runokay which trains mechanical engineerswhich trains people how to go aboutusing instruments and be of you knowrelevance in the shop flow but many moresuch are required not for just theengineering now the PM vishwakarma ythat we've come up with okay is the onewhich says for people who are workingwith some bare minimum toolsin other words working essentially withtheir hands but probably using a minimumset of tools they shall be propertraining given they will be given a kindof a stifen during the course post whicha 15,000 rupees worth of Kit will beprovided to them okay and with thatcertification today they can qualify formany of these big ticket jobs orassignments or contracts or subsubcontract RS and so on so yeah theseare serious problems of people withinadequate skill sets aspiring forjobs Ma I was reading something calledthe skill India report and what youmentioned is great for the bottom of thepyramid but what I'm deeply concernedabout is the middle of the pyramid ma'ambecause this skill India report saysthat just give me asecond now the skill India report saysthat more than 35% of of our btechstudents are unemployable 30% of our MBAstudents are unemployable 60% of ouritti students are unemployable and morethan 75% of our poly Technic studentsare unemployable so and you know ma'am Ihave been the perfect witness to thisentire transition because 10 years backI was in college and I am that studentthat you're talking about who thoughtafter college I'll find a great job butby the end of college I realize that Ido not know anything that is relevant tothe industry today and 10 years laternow I'm recruiting engineers and I'msaying the same problem M they'rereading out of outdated textbooksthey're reading outdated Concepts andthey do not know anything that isrelevant for today's industry so ma'amhow are we solving this problem for themiddle of the pyramid which is ourengineers and management students atleast you've uh put your example forwardfirst thing I think and this is not tosay it's it's not part of government'sownresponsibility the drive that anindividual has to recogrecognize that this is not going to workout for him and he has to find adifferent thing as I say get your mojoback how do you get your mojo back onceyou identify that you don't seem to haveyour mojo in a particular area and ifyou have to acquire it what is it thatyou have to do and once you identifythere are now online or offline coursesavailable for you to be able to equipyour self better that is one and secondpeer group learning is something which Ithink till my college days we've all allbenefited from today the world is sofast we think my each of our mobileswill be are peers no way yeah peers arethose who will be able to sit with youand put you the context in which you'llhave to search for what is missing inyou those kind of interactions are nowbecoming very few and far between that'sa second and a third it is true youquoted the I I unfortunately are withthe state governments many stategovernments in the last 30 40 years havestopped investing in them why do youneed to invest in them upgrade the toolsbring in new world tools with whichyou'll train the young person and uh notjust in the same repeated uh skillsthere are newer areas in which we wantpeople to come take the example of todaythe expansion in renewable energyparticularly solar who are the youngpeople who are laying the panels who aresetting the panels to a certain anglefacing the sun who are those peoplethey're not highend skilled workerswhere did they acquire and today the tomeet the ever growing demand of solarenergy you have people who are servicingit you have people who understand howthe film has to be you know maintainedcleaned and how it has got to be placedand so on so thatsector has found itself having to adjustvery quickly to changingrequirements similarly for other sectorstoo we need both the state and thecentral government together with privatesector joining hand to say I need goodtrained Workforce or else I'm not goingto be able to fill the Gap that's whathappened during thecovid I've been in touch with most ofthe industry during covid when it wasall shut up to make sure that theworkers go back to where they want to goback that they are not facing anyhardship and so on similarly after thelockdown waslifted I was in touch with them again tosay are they coming back you would besurprised to hear that many of them whobooked the air tickets and got theseworkers earlier through some middleperson were told no sorry we are notcoming back why because these workersfound better bargaining okay with otherareas so they were able to choose to goto a different company or with theskills that they acquired they thoughtthey'll be able to do something of theirown in their own neighborhoods in TheVillages I heard at least two largeindustrialist tell me and they belong tothe South they said um well I'm notgetting the same people who I hadtrained over the last several years I'mgoing to have to invest to get newerfellows and train them but well now I'verealized that how much of you do itmight be better off for you to get localfellows and train them so many of theSouthern districts of Tamil Nadu alsowhich face uh labor related problemsbecause they don't have enoughopportunities were picked up and theywere trained and even they had adifferent level of satisfaction becausenow they're very closer to home they'rewilling to work so such reset in thelabor market is happening postco soma'am you're saying that the center andthe state need to again coordinate onthis and make sure that there's anindustry academic connect such that thedemand and Supply both are matched rightnow the one question that I had thenwhich had worked initially very wellprob continues to work in the domain ofstartups where we brought in thesestartups to join hands with the uh thehubs which were set up in IIT likeplaces Indian Institute of Sciences likeplaces people came there sat with themand they help them to understand wherethe problem is and where the solutionshave have got to come and it has becomea big catalytic Center these hubs M theone question that had and this is purelyout of curiosity is that why don't wejust put a restriction on the number ofengineering colleges that are opening upbecause ma'am to be honest in Pune thereare colleges that are being set upmerely for the sake of making money andthe professors are incompetent they arejust great with marketing and thesestudents and parents who come from faraway Villages they come to thesecolleges and then there is a there's asales team which convinces them andsells them dreams that you know we'll beable to get you a 4.5 lakh package we'llbe able to get you a .5 lakh package andeventually after 4 years after takingeducation loan also these people are notable to find jobs and this pointstowards a larger problem also becausetoday if we say that you know we have1.3 million Engineers coming out to aforeign investor this seems like a goldmine because if 1.3 million Engineersare coming out every year that is greatplus a labor cost are low but when thatperson comes over here and actually seesthe quality of our engineers and he seesthat most of our Engineers are notengineers at all that that number onedents the reputation of the country andnumber two all of these engineeringcolleges are not engineering colleges atall they're just engineering collegesfor the name sake so again with thecenter State coordination do we havesomething by which we can curb theexpansion of these engineeringinstitutes in such a way that whateverSupply we have we have concrete supplyand the rest of the people can just findsomething else to do rather than beingdeceived by these engineering collegesin the name of great packages absolutelya very very critical question and anissue which is definitely a festeringissue many of them who borrow money andaim to have their children go high intheir lives have been shattered yeah andquality lessinfrastructure uh facultyless programs have actually hurt thesector I know the example that you citedof is also applicable in many parts ofSouthern States many engineeringcolleges are just lying there correctlike huge concrete monsters with nothingin it true there has to certainly be alot more vigilance in this matter andlot more compliance of Standards okayma'am ma'am the next question that Ihave is about GST and ma'am GST withouta doubt has been a phenomenal successbecause my Chacha G is extremely enviousof us because we don't have to face thesame problems that he did during thattime and all the stakeholders that Ispoke to in fact we made a video on GSTand we asked people to comment as abusiness owner whether they were happywith GST or not and most of the peoplesaid yes but there's one category ofstakeholder who's particularly not happyabout GST and those other stategovernments like Tamil Nadu and Kela manbefore that I just want to set thepremise for this just so that I have theunderstanding of how GST operatesproperly if a t-shirt worth 100 rupeesis produced in Tamil Nadu and it is soldin a state like up and if 20 rupees GSTis collected on this t-shirt 10 Rupeesgoes to the center and 10 Rupees goes tothe state right and out of this 10 rupethat goes to the state it goes to theconsumer state which is up and nonproducer state which is Tamil Nadu rightgovernments like Tamil Nadu often arguethat we've invested thousands of Crowesinto setting up factories buildinghighways then why is it that our benefitof producing the goods are being passedon to other states where there are justmore number of people out there to justconsume the goods so ma'am how do youMa'am why don't we just split I knowthis is a very amateur question ma'amand I know that there are complexcalculations in place but why don't wejust split the GST between the producerState and the consumer Stateequally how would that work out afterthe 20 rupes that is collected 10 rupesgoes to the center 5 rupees goes to theproducer State and 5 rupees goes to theconsumer State wouldn't that be enoughto in a way isn't isn't that what isworking because you how do you knowwhich product will be consumed to whatextent in a particular State M maybesome states consume more of M let's sayjary products some other states Mayconsume a lot moreof Metal Goods so for item wise I'llhave to and some other states Mayconsume one item this month and maybenot the nextmonth so you can't have a thumb Rule anddo it it has to be on actual buying andselling that is why this complex systemwas bought simply saying how much getsso so in a particular State and that iswhy when GST was launched in2017 manufacturing states were allunhappy saying I lose my advantage I gotso many Industries to come to my placeset up the business now are you saying Iwon't get my share no they werecompensated for it so that they theycome come on board saying okaymanufacturing States will be givensomething you know and they agreed tosome kind of a settlement because nowthe emphasis or the principle ofTaxation moves on to the consumer youtake that measure okay ma'am so afterthis compensation is now applicable till2026 right the GST compensation no it'sover it was till 2022 and then it's overyes it's over okay what you're gettingtill 26 is the compensation tax getscollected okay it goes towards thepayment of the principle and theinterest on the borrowings that we didokay during the lockdown when nothingmoved no GST revenues were generated butstill States had to be given moneybecause how will they run otherwisecorrect so money was borrowed and givento states on the understanding that itwill have to be paid back by thecompensation cess that we use okay andthat compensation says was thereforeextended Beyond22 strictly only to pay thecompensations due that was to be paidassume okay that during the lockdown ifeverything was normal no lockdown youwould have earned as much as you gave aswell correct without earning your givingbecause you borrowed that borrowing hasto be paid from where it has to be paidfrom the same cess that gets collectedso although till 22 we gave it to theStates now having extended it till till26 the collected money goes only forpaying the borrowed amount okay and it'sservicing of the interest Okay so until2022 they were compensated but after2022 till2026 whatever the state gave to thecenter during the times of covid no nono what about the GST Council borrowedto pay the states okay and that is nowbeing collected in the form of the samecess is getting collected till 26 okayand the collected cess between 22 and 26goes for paying that borrowed amountwhich the GST Council borrowed to paythe state's the compensation says okayduring the lockdown see between 272017 and2022 states were given a 14%compensation okay meaning every statebased on the20156 base year would be growing at aparticular level level each state grewat at its own level based on the trendof the earliercollection but the GST at the time oflaunching agreed that it will be assumedthat all states will grow in say at a14% level now if you actually grew onlyat 10% level hardly any state grew at 10but many of them grew at seven or 8%best performers the others perform lessbetter whatever be itso if you actually grew at only 7 or8% the rest s or 6% would be given toyou by the compensation cess which waslevied on extra luxurious or sinfulGoods okay okay so that money wascollected in the name of compensationcess and that was used to give thedifferen sh between actually whatRevenue was earned and the protectedRevenue which is 14% will be beguaranteed to every state so between 14and 7 The Gap was paid through thecompensation cess okay but that was onlyup to22 and in the covid year because wecouldn't collect anything we borrowedmoney and kept that promiseup all right so who's going to pay theborrowedmoney after 22 we extended thecollection and with that money we arepaying back the borrowed moneyunderstood ma'am ma'am this is very veryclear to usbecause um from the mainstream mediawhat I understood is that there arestates like Tamil Nadu which wereprotesting because they were saying thatit's like penalizing the states forinvesting so much money into buildingfactories when there are states that arejust consuming things is not buildingfactories what are you saying no they'resaying is that we spent we put in somuch efforts and thousand of Cl intobuilding highways but um all of ourefforts are being penalized because ourrevenu is going to the consumer statethat was the narrative so I just wantedto ask you that question okay ma' thenext question that I have is about thisagain north south divide that's outthere and I want you to clarify thisjust like you did forGST and this is coming from thedivisible pool of taxes by the way guysuh for those who don't know this is justfor the audience if the center collects1,000 crores 41% of it in 2024 goes toall the states so 1.8% might go toKerala 6% will go to Maharashtra and soon and so forth and the financecommission decides which state will gethow muchpercent and this pool right now is about12 lakh crores right ma'am is thatcorrect okay ma'am here's where theFinance Minister of Kerala Ken balgopalargues he says that Kera gets only 21Rupees against every 100 rupe that Keracollects but for up this number is 46out of 100 and for Bihar it'sdrastically High Bihar gets 70 rupeesout of the 100 rupe that it collects andhere's where the north south dividenarrative comes into play ma'am so ma'amwhat is the logic behind dividing thispool of money between different statesand why is there such a drasticdifference first of all I think thisnarrativeis somewhat distorted okay I'm notcoming into saying the numbers aredistorted I'm not even I'm saying theprinciple on the basis of which this isbeing put out is absolutely distortedokay I'll start from an example and I'llelaboratelet's take Kerala let's take Tamil Nadulet's takeKarnataka if actually the total amountof Revenue or taxation that you pay isthe principle on the basis of which taxhas to be given back to you koi inKerala would take away everything thatis collected yeah all right coochi whichbenefits from having one of the world'sbest portswhich is a national port in whichgovernment of India's money goes in thatPort is built maintain run modernized upkeep everything is with thecenter look at the way in whichcomplexity gets into the argument yeahall right now Ki therefore also has aairport to which the central civilaviation Ministry spends a thought okayKi also has one of the biggest centersofNavy for which central governmentexclusively spends money now all of themhave a ripple effect on the economy Kicorrectright but even after that if KeralaRepresentatives say Ki gives so much taxare you first of all excluding these bigtietInvestments which are giving the rippleeffect for the Kieconomy and pretending that everythingthat which is happening in kuchi is madeout of kerala's ownmoney so it starts with a bit of anillogic there okaysecond if koi alone is able to generatesomuch what happens to canor what happensto tiur what happens to further uphod what happens toPanAm are we thensing everything that koochi gives Kochigets back be damned with the rest of thedistricts so in the case of TamilNadu everything which happens in Chennaior kambur goes back to Chennai and katurbe done with veur of the world um umperambalur of the world forgetramapuram would you say that no youcan't do anything inarur so come similarly to Karnataka yourchitra yourB raichur Yad will all be left becauseevery money will have to be going backtoBangalore so what are we trying toconvey I'm not even getting to talkingabout you know we give one rupe we getonly 25 PESA no I'm not even coming tothat first of all as I took the Kiexample I'll take Bangaloreexample how many Industries in KKarnataka and also in bangaluru ormangaluru are funded by thecenter leave all that the Common ManTravels bytrain is the Karnataka leg of the trainbeing funded by Karnataka governmentcentral government funds it A to B B toC C toZ Railways are fully with similarly AirForce bangaluru has one of the Air Forcebig centers Army Headquarters there oneof the Southern division isthere are there not monies coming fromthe center yeah so I want this wholething to be placed in its proper contextand again throwing it as though it isprime minister modi's government whichdecides on these rates is a deliberateattempt to mislead after all people weresitting in governance holdingresponsible constitutional positions dorealize that these are not percentagesdecided by prime minister or thegovernment of India there is aconstitutional body called the financecommission that decidesit so when that next commission comeswhich is already constituted the 16thmeet them and tell put your casesforward now what are the most importantparameters that the finance commissionconsiders while Distributing this moneyfrom the divisible pool a few thingsremain throughout and a few others keepchanging being brought in and so on andI know the one solid argument which thesouthern states would put in is aboutpopulation yeah uh also put aboutschools and colleges and medicalfacilities and so on but whatever beit the arguments will have to be put tothe consideration of the financecommission and once the financecommission decides on the rates we haveto follow it so population is oneparameter m'am any other major I thinkeducation climateresilience many other many other thingsso obviously when you talk of statesgstp and the population it'll all fallin place okay because here's where againKerala brings another argument right nowK is facing an economic crisis and Ijust did some math and they said thatyou know from the 10th Financecommission to the 15th Financecommission our share in the divisiblepool has decreased from 3.8% to 1.9%that yeah I want to say yeah I want tosay even before you completeyour for till the Constitution andcompletion of the work of the 14thFinancecommission 14th Finance commission'sreport was submitted in 2014 first thingwhich after the Prime Minister tookcharge in 2014 14th Finance commission'sreport came okay so till then beginningthe 10th till the14th mostly it was the UPA governmentokay mostly in in most of these UPACongress L UPA governments Kerala hashad at least five or more ministerssittingthere other than the Kerala governgovernment themselves couldn't theministers in the Kerala I mean inCongress L UPA ministers who came fromCongress tell their own governmentsaying please go back to the financecommission kerala's revenue is comingdown to pick it up now and throw it atus 10th 11th 12th 13th 14th 15th theythemselves are saying right yeah fromthe 10th to 14th it's all been fallingit was allyours because ma'am the argument iscoming right now and is becoming morerelevant because right now they'refacing an economic crisis and I try tounderstand the gravity of this argumentso 3.8% I mean I'm sorry to interruptagain tosay Revenue falling may be one of theproblems your own State's efficiency incollecting revenues what is the problemover there ma'am why is it so I'm askingI'm asking this as a question okay whynot look at your own State's resourcesthat you collect be more efficient bringin more elements into into it andalso the borrowing on which they went tothe court to the Supreme Court I'masking budgetary borrowingextrabudgetaryborrowing please account for all of themin the assembly where electedrepresentatives of caralasitting you don't talk about theborrowing which has been extra budgetaryand continuing at some level tillnow whereas you have a problem withRevenue falling this if the centralshare is falling I'm also asking everystate has its own way of improving theirown collection their own State's ownresources understood ma'am so you'resaying that disil pool is not apractical solution they have to managetheir economic also one of the thingsthey have to give their own attentionmany states have shown rapid changes inthe way in which they brought in morecreative ways of Revenue generation okayfor example ma'am uh look at the waystamp Duty has been handled okayMaharashtra for instance during covidrealized that unless they were going tochange their approach towards stamp Dutythe inventory which was sitting in realestate meaning built propertieshousing will languish and they changethe rate and what a difference itmade they collected more Revenue theinventory with all the builders wascleared now there's fresh demand formore housing that is one of the ways todo it the other way to do it there arestill some items which are exclusivelyleft to thestates in that are you efficient I'm notasking for a increase in tax becausebecause I know there is this temptationpeople will immediately say that ohshe's suggesting increasing tax no I'mnot saying that efficient tax collectionefficient tax collection plugloopholes make sure that you're usingTechnologies to understand where evationis happening loophole is one thingevasion isanother you know there can be people whoare completely avoiding paying taxesfinding out ways in which they can skipthe net correct are we proving all thatma'am you have done a phenomenal jobwith GST because the number of taxpayers is increasing the amount of taxcollected is increasing and you broughtin some revolutionary policies to maketax collection more efficient so ma'amhow did you do it uh by first of all Imust say the Readiness to adopttechnology and to deploy technology tomake it simple is something which primeminister has done in Gujarat okay he hasprime minister now as chief minister inGujarat and as prime minister nowcontinuously kept us pushing saying canyou not bring in technology to assesswhere it goes how it gets collected canyou not see using you know artificialintelligence where you can trace themoney and where loopholes are happeningor where wrong hands are receiving letus say the refund that you're paying orfalse claims being laid saying I'veexported so much give me some money backwhere actual export has not happenedonly paper you know shuffling ishappened so using technology for thepurposes of better Revenue collectionhas actually given us good resultsotherwise you will be fishing or as yousay in Technology based languageinternet B based language fishingExpedition would be going on you'll beyou know doing a wild goose chase whatwe are doing now is when you do with theAI you're able to get the entire spidersweb as it were so one leads to anotherthird leads to the fourth fourth leadsto something else so you touch oneyou're able to touch everybody else sothe whole web just falls apart ma'am canyou give me one example ofthis one example of this was in theinput tax credit okay in theGST you get the creditor if there is an inversion you get therefund back okay in suchcases where there's no transactionhappening but bills are being shown youended up having to base the bill pay thepeople okay but the bills are only paperwork like even in the toll tax which wasmoving a truck would move up and downtwo or three times with no stuff in itoh okay and the claim would be thistruck went four times and therefore youhave to pay us to that extent okay withno Mal was transported okay that came tolight because U particularly becauseGujarat and utar Pradesh both came upsaying something is Hanky Panky herewe'll have to check it up how did theyidentify that ma'am one truck the sametruck registration number how many timeswill he go within a matter of 48 hoursin two different distances which aremore than 300 km each I'm saying roughlyokay so then they got Noy about thewhole thing and when they when theyactually went in to find out they got toknow it ma'am this almost looks like aNetflix documentary that's right most ofthe Customs related and GST relatedmatters are all coming up because ofthese kind of mild deficiencies whichofficers say you know they detectsomething and then they're curious theywant to tie tie up the Los ends they endup seeing a big problemand Technology helps them today insteadof having to you know spend hourssearching for where it goes who's thefellow ultimately receives it becausemoney Trail is so quickly establishedthis is almost like an fmcg companytrying to find out leakage that isexcellent ma'am ma'am one lastquestion if your government comes topower what is your vision for India from2024 to 2029 ma'am I think broadly it'svery well laidout first of all get to the threeuh third largest economy okay within ayear and a half or two okay unless youknow something Black Swan we don't knowbut otherwise we should be able to okayand work towards 2047 viit Barat andprimary use of doing business for thatyes and to make sure that manufacturingmake in India atbar bat all go hand inhand you already have a service sectorwhich is contributing more than 60% toour G GDP P you already have anagriculture sector where there's a lotof activity today to export and give thefarmer better Returns on his producebecause exporting abroad he gets moneyin foreign exchange that gives himbetter yield assurance that his productswill be sold at that price and so on sothe comfort of export will have to alsobe extended but of course because inIndia we can't be indifferent to theprices at which product will be sold theconsumer end of agricultural products isalso important Farmers important theother end the consumer is important soeverything going for export is going tomake it too expensive and probably Goodswill not be available for Indianconsumers correct so we'll have to finda balance there for agriculture andManufacturing as I said so balance foragriculture manufacturing isas of doingbusiness eventually leading us to thethird largest economy and the vision of2047 is that correct ma'am thank you somuch ma'am thank you so much so much forbeing so patient with all of youranswers especially for giving examplesbecause I was able to understandeverything I just hope everybody elsedid thank you so much ma'am it was apleasure to have you thank you very muchthank you so much[Music]

Video script India is voting it's the biggestelection ever it'll likely be Democraticfree and fair but everyone knows who'sgoing towinra modely Mr NarendraModi I think it's going tobe this ishim he's already been prime minister fora decade another win would give him fivemore years in charge of the world's mostpopulous country although he seems tohave his sight set even furtherahead it's a vote for a personality it'sa vote for a leadership of a man whatyou seeing here is quite remarkable pro-incumbency so this in itself is a hugepolitical achievement it does appearright now that there is no[Music]alternative I'm Nisha jwal and I've beenreporting on India ever since Modi firstcame to power almost a decade ago and hestill looks unbeatable it'sextraordinary how has he done it how hashe become seemingly the only choice in ademocratic nation of one 1.4 billionpeople modi's journey to power startedhere in the city of vad nagar in theEastern State of Gujarat the originalstory he tells includes helping out athis father's tea stall at the localrailway station it's never beencorroborated but it's an important partof his political message because whenpeople see that people of humblebackgrounds are doing better that sendsout a message that sends out a very veryimportant message swapan Das Gupta ispart of the national executive of theBJP modi's party I think one of thethings which Modi has done so far issent out that message that look anyIndian can in theory makeit he started early he was just eightwhen he first went to youth meetings atthe rria swam saak s the RSS that's ahuge volunteer organization focused onpromoting a Hindu way of life orhinda and it is where the BJP originatedRSS is a at least itelf image is that ofsocial cultural body it believes that itis actually nurturingTalentleadership for the sake of nationbuilding it's today probably the largestvolunteer movement which exists in Indiaat present and one which has atremendous amount of influence curtsyitsrelationship with the BJP at 19 Modijoined the RSS full-time and soon becameone of its crucial prar or missionarieshis job was to promote RSS HinduDoctrine which he did for 15 years

home state this createdstrong roots for him in Gujaratsomething that would prove extremelyvaluable for the rest of his politicallife it also made his name within theBJP to take the Gujarat BJPfrom position where it was not even themain opposition party to becoming themain Force he was he had a very veryimportant role in galvanizing the forcesEtc so his role in Gujarat as apolitical mobilizer was alwaysrecognized so Modi was perfectly placedto step in and rescue that stategovernment when it ran into trouble in2001 he became chief minister normallyRSS people are not pulled out and me togo into the administration one of thefirst times an exception was May and wasP somehow salvaged thesituation but the burning of a traincarrying Hindu pilgrims Just 4 monthsafter Modi took the top job in

US and the UK for yearsover this but 10 years later a specialinvestigation team cleared him ofwrongdoing Mr Modi is seen as theideological purist at that time there isa term which is used for him

Gandhi family was drowning inthese scandals for many there was asense of betrayal people's frustrationwith the party had reached a boilingpoint and when elections rolled aroundin 2014 conditions were ripe for Modi sothere was firstly that thing about Indialosing its wayand here is a we need a strong leaderwho in Gujarat has shown that you canactually take it forward in a particulardirection with with firmness withdecisiveness and secondly which I thinkdon't want to under underplay itssignificance is that Modi was alsoregarded in various ways as a Hinduleader as the first sort of Hindu

sending manypeople in informal work paid in cashscrambling for valid notes to save theirlivelihoods that was just 2 years intohis first term but that wasn't the lasttime Modi would make stunning surpriseannouncements as he has settled intoPower the pm has taken several suchsteps that would arguably have beenpolitical suicide for other lesserpoliticians their effects may have beenquestionable but Mod's image as a strongman of action has benefiteddemonetization you know most economistswould argue was just a bad policy thedemonetization really kind of seems tohave killed the back of the informaleconomy even the the way thedemonetization was first motivated rightas you as as a bitter pill thateverybody needs to swallow for thegreater good of the country uh it wasreally a masterclass in communicationand despite the suffering thatdemonetization undeniably caused just afew months later the BJP won crucialState elections in India's most popularstate uttar Pradesh so to actually atthe back of what you know is clearly uhyou know an economic policy gonemassively wrong uh you have a thumpingpolitical Victory so why weren't peoplemore angry with the government there wasa sense in which the misery was sharedand that the the poor especially andremember in India the poor in the lowermiddle class vote in overwhelminglylarger numbers than the rich in theupper middle class it is widely feltthat the poor and lower middle classabsorbed that for the first time astrong decision had been made thataffected the rich as much as it affectedthe poor there was some kind ofcatharsis in in shared misery and it wasmisery clearly right Modi also madestunning and sudden decisions during theco pandemic waves of desperate m workersleft cities on foot when the firstlockdown was announced and criticsblamed government mismanagement for thehigh death toll of the second wave thesedecisions caused distress and heartachefor Millions but did not damage himintention of Mr Modi has not beenquestioned and I think everyone means hemeans he means well and so toughdecisions are taken and I think peoplehave given him the benefit of the doubt[Music][Applause][Music]I feel very strongly about this thecitizenship of amendment because it'ssometimes for it'sreally trying to tie up some of theLoose Ends of partition this whole thingwas done for people who fled fromreligious persecution for those who ofthe minorities who got left on the wrongside of the partition divide and saythat if you come to India you will beaccommodated uh with dignity and honorand citizenship these changes make iteasier for minorities from neighboringMuslim countries to become Indiancitizens but not Muslims they merged theHindu ideology of the RSS modi'spolitical base with nationalisticpride the bill sparked some of thebiggest protests the Modi government hadseen this women's sitting in Delhilasted over 3 months a BJP leadercalling for these protests to be brokenup sparked riots in the Capital 53people were killed most of them Muslimsthe Hindu nationalist support for thisbill was clear Hindu nationalism is seenas the point of Indian assertion Indiacoming into its own in the world Indiabecoming a developed country it's alsolinked with the fact not in a veryaggressive or in a malevolent sort ofway but the fact that you are also aHinducountry modi's Hindu National ISM restson India's huge Hindu majority theyaccount for about 80% of thecountry so he benefited politically whenhe removed the special status of India'sonly Muslim majority State Jammu andKashmir despite criticism saying ittargetedMuslims and remember this image of ayoung Modi on his way up in the BJP hewas with the party Elder pushing for aram Temple to be built on the site of amosque in aodha that campaign helpedrile up Hindu mobs who tore down themosque 32 years later Modi built thatTemple and while that needed a courtdecision Modi placed himself at thecenter of celebrations getting thecredit for the wildly popularwhat was subliminal has been broughtinto the open that's really what hashappened what has happened is that beingHindu hasbecome no longer a matter of beingdefensive about it but more importantbeing Hindu has also become a source ofPride and here you're defi you'redefying some of the larger Trendsglobally particularly in Europe whereism is seen as a dirty word[Applause]Modi has an image as Incorruptible ahighly spiritual man who is practicallymarried to the job contrary to most howpolitics plays out in India the PrimeMinister doesn't have a family of hisown and so there's a perception that hedoesn't need to do anything for his nextgeneration and so he's personallyIncorruptible but of course money hasn'tdisappeared from Indian politics farfrom it when the BJP under Mr Modi comesin it's a ruthless party they dominatethe resources now more than they've everdone so this has been a phenomena since2014 and they almost they're completelyon top of that front so other partiesstruggle the BJP still loudly promisesto root out corruption that's themessage you see in the advertisementbehind me here it reads they say savethe corrupt Mr Modi says removecorruption but the charges politiciansare facing today seem to have a patterndelhi's popular chief minister arindkrial was arrested accused of financialcrimes authorities have taken suchaction against several oppositionpoliticians in the runup to State andnationalelections if you have a match you have afootball match let's say so one side isuh half the players have been shown redcards in center of the field that'swhat's happening right now the chiefminister of jarand is in jail the chiefminister of Delhi is in jail theCongress accounts are frozen till theother day and even now they're infinancial trouble that is like not beingable to play with the full team andeveryone else who's playing is stillfacing facing cases do BJP cars alsoface these kind of Investigations nothey don't they don't I mean those whohave recruited been recruited by the BJPtheir investigations have gone awaymedia houses have also faced charges offinancial misdemeanors including the BBCand the wire an Indian news websitecritical of the government the BJP saysthese charges are legitimate inquiriesnot attempts to silence criticalvoices uh they are an extension ofcertain political parties or politicalforces in in the country which they aremore than just ordinary news portals anduh they stillexist nobody stopped them they mighthave had to answer a few questions but Ithink they exist and I don't thinkthey'll be stopped yet India's rankinghas steadily declined in the world pressFreedom index so it's not as the mediaisover it's just that it's it's not easyyou you will face harassment you will betold by editors not to do the X and Yand yes but there is an attemptdefinitely to intimidate and to monitorthe space and there is a there are newlaws coming about the digital space andso on so the traditional media iscompletely obedient and they don't askthe Prime Minister any questions andhe's he's never had an Open PressConference as we've examined people feellike the economy is doing well many likehis Hindu nationalism and he'sestablished himself as a decisive muchLov leader at the head of anincreasingly dominant political party inIndia Modi is approaching this electionfrom a very strong position there's noother worthwhile option actuallyavailable and in fact there's no otheroptions you know we there would be analternative to Modi but currentlylooking at current scenarios there hasbeen no options right now there's a lackof options in general it's the bjp'sgreat achievement that it has managed toget itself into the position of becomingthe default party as being the thingwhere where if the thing is there is noalternative they the choice is that ofthe BJP these are the people who wouldchallenge that congress's top leader hasmade two Journeys spanning the lengthand breadth of India they head acoalition of more than 20 partiesstanding against Modi and his BJP butthey are in disarray distracted byinfighting and walkouts the oppositionis in trouble but the I I mean theCongress comes out with beautifulstatements they they make they show theintent of having beautiful schemes butto date they are slow about theirstrategies they are slow to hit theground to announce their candidatesthey are also under attacks from the BJPthat tap into Hindu fears ofMuslims attacks which many say are hatespeech a Modi Victory still seems likelybut how big will it be now the questionis what kind of numbers Will he win whatwill be the state of the Judiciary orthe or the courts which are supposed tobe independent will they be able tountether India entirely from theConstitutional and that will depend onthe the numbers of course if there is a3-4 majority there will be pressure onthem to move India in a direction whichis ideologically more in sync with thethinking of the parent organization theRSS that would be good news for Hindunationalists but alarming for minoritiesparticularly Muslims who already feelunder pressure and whatever Modi wantsto do with India in the coming years hisability to do it will depend on theeconomy here there areconcerns is that can we get rich beforewe get old is the cultural agenda goingto take away from capacity that you haveto focus singularly on economic reformsright once you assume a lot of power areyou still willing to listen to a broadset ofideas right and and and course correctis internal criticism allowed a strongeconomic performance will also be neededto maintain India's new Bolder positionon the world stagewhen a nation is not backed by some sortof an economicmuscle it becomes the target of unendingcondescension and I think the problemwas India was listen to as a sort of oldcivilization but it was seen more in anexotic commodity rather than somethingin the modern world I think what Bodhihas done is he's kept that exoticismthere the yoga is still very much a partof India but he's built onthat for a decade Modi has beenasserting himself on the worldstage and as Western leaders look moretowards India to help limit China'sinfuence in the region so Modi becomesmore assertive in international circlesso even if for example now um you know arespected uh you know foreignpublication is doing a critical analysisof India unfortunately doesn't stick inmy opinion as much as it would have 2030 years ago uh because of almost thisconsensus that has developed withinIndia that we don't need to be told whatto do that sense of confidence is likelyto inform India's and modi's future thisamount ofself-confidence which Modi has been ableto impart to the averageIndian is somethingwhich is more thanpolitics I think when people look backto the Modiera they will see that it was probably averymajor point oftransformation positivetransformation of India and how we seeourselves and that's the story that'sworking that's making Modi unbeatableit's a story a vast majority of Indianswant to believe in and that's powerfulstuff inpolitics we've seen how Modi startedwith the perfect origin story rememberthat image of the poor hardworking te-Celler boy and he came up via the partyrather than a dynasty building on solidroots in community leadership and astrong record in state governance he sawhis moment when the country was sick ofcorrupt government DEC and took it andhe spent a decade creating a leadershipcult based on his incorruptibility anddecisive leadership and on people'sdesire to be a part of a Hindu IndiaRising but the true test of democracyhere would be whether that India Mod'sIndia brings all its people along[Applause]it[Applause]

it's greatterminology it's good stuff yesso let's start with the maker modeyou were a developer in your startup iwas a business guy in my startup i thinkin many ways this stuff came a littlebit moreumnatively to youand i had to learn this stuff by likebasically destroying the productivity ofmy co-founders sohow did you think about makers mode as afoundermost companiesare set up around a manager schedulewhere you have a day packed with meetingafter meeting and so if you're aprogrammer at a big company you wouldhave toyou know you'd have like an hour toprogram here an hour to program thereandthis is badthis was not conducive to to buildingthings okay and so to just walk throughmy perspective of someone thatyou know was programming back in the daywhen i when i was a startup founderumwhen you're programmingthe more of the program you can keep inyour head at any one timethe the easier it is for you to knowwhat's going on and have the context uphere to make changes and fix bugs and ittakes like an hour or twocoldof looking at a program and figuringstuff out for it to get loaded into ramso to speakand so if you're interruptedlike if you have to program in hourincrementsman are you gonna sucklike you constantlyhave to restart your state every timeyou program and so a great makerschedule is something like an eight-houruninterrupted block of time and hisargument i think he was alsotalking about this from the perspectiveof an artist or a musician like if youwanted to record an album or write musicor if you wanted to write a book thesame deal if you had to write a book in20-minute incrementsi think a lot of writers wouldn't lovethatfairwhich is so much different than thebusiness guy like i you know i was thebusiness guy at my startup andyou certainly can do emailin 20 minute incrementsor hour incrementsand so i remember having thisconversation with emmett where he saidmichael imagine that i'm doingridiculously complicated word problemsand you're interrupting me in the middleof themand i was like then it clicked i waslike oh well i've had to do hard worklike like i went to school i had to dothat that's what your day is likeone that sounds a lot harder thanwriting emails but twoi would hate to be interrupted like thatand once he said that it kind of clickedum before he said that i just assumedwell you know he's typing on typing yeahhe's typing thingsand and i remember i remember when iread the post what resonated with me isi felt like my work day really beganaround five or six pm isn't that weirdand that's because what that's whenthings would quiet down and i would stopgetting email and the building i wasworking out of would quiet down andthat's where actually all the goodprogramming happened was at the end ofthe daywhat was interesting was thatfor uswe basically had to figure out how tobuild that in i think in the beginningorganically it happened because you knowthat was our sleep cycle we were allliving in an apartment together but whenwe had more employees we had an officeyou know we literally and this issomething that i just noticed happenedorganically nothing got done beforelunchlike getting to work was all about likegetting in answering your email doing acouple meetings like it was just likeno one who was writing code even wantedto start writing code before lunchbecause lunch was the big like fu in themiddle of the dayand our whole trick wasone how do we not serve a lunch makeseveryone go to sleepand two how do we make that post lunchtimefree of everythingpg in some waysdesigned yc a little bit that way righti think that's counterintuitive to a lotof founders like onethere aren't that many events you don'thave classes all day at yc like you knowwe try to take as little time aspossible during your week so you canactually get donetwo there's a hard deadlinedemo dayand three i think people are oftensurprised likea good portion of yc is just asking youwhat are you going to accomplish by demodayand then asking you every week well didyou do ityep and it's you confronting the yes orno of that likeit turns out that likethere's a lot of magic on that and hewanted to build as much maker time aspossible in the program i think in thiskind of balance between maker mode andmanager modewhat people should be trying to do ismaximize their productivity when they'rein that moderight how do you maximize productivityso when i think about manager mode forme i always like to think about thislikeokay if i'm going to be managing my timebetween my to-do list which isjust another way of saying that'sactually important to get donemeetingsemailand slacki always think that my to-do list comesfirst like whenever i'm being productivei start at the to-do listand i do everything there and then icheck those things whenever i control ityes versus if it's inbox drivenother people are in control of your timewhich is watch outhorriblehorrible the second thing is aroundmeetings and like we talk about this alot like you're gonna have to have somemeetingsumi've seen a couple tricks but they canall be reduced down to write downthe worst thing is when you have to haveanother meeting because people didn'twrite the down from the firstmeetinglike like that is like when you knowyou've punched yourself in theface but like i'm so shocked it's likeno one again let me push you on thatbecause you and i agree but let me letme let's make this clear the audiencewhat are we saying what we mean is sayyou and i are an immediate we agree onsomethingif narus writes it down it's like itnever happenedit's like we justwe were like patting ourselves on theback what a great meeting right michaelno one writes it down we're like what dowe talk abouteven if i didn't think i needed itoh let's write down the agenda oh let'swrite our notes where we decided uhthat would be great any other thingsthat have made you productive as amanager the number one thingthat i do that i realize that a lot ofthe other successful founders did toowas ihad my analytics dashboard or whateverwas important kpis on the business up onmy screen 24 7 and i would stare at itall the time and i actually couldmemorizei even this is even the case for yc mani don't even know if you know this butlike a lot of our internal stats i havememorized yesand it's because i stare at them all thetime and no one told me to do that thisis just a me thingbut i'm like obsessedwith like the internal key kpis foranything i'm working on i'm just like anaddict to look at that stuffi think that that is such what we see onthe other side and i completely agreewith you that was a huge thingespecially for my second startup thatwas a really huge thingit's funny when you talk to a founderwho knows their stats wellthey just talk about their stats sodifferently you know likeman like the first of all they don'tround off numbers to the nearest likezero you know likebut second of all they know whetherthey're up or down 10 percent at like atany given time like at any given timewhereas other founders is like yeah ithink it was an up week butit's like how do you not knowhow do you not know if your revenue likewent up this week likewhat are you what are you doing yeah noi i don't get it i don't get whensomeone is like operating a business andit's like what was i do we what was ourrevenue last monthbut but like keeper they they give thatto me at the end of the month and it'slike what likeor people didn't know i mean for us itwas you know daus and it was like amountof video watched but it's likeeveryoneon the founding team knew when we hadless traffic today than yesterdayeveryone right like just just like inlike in their bones likeoh i i think my last point on thismanager schedule the thing i would justadd is what i've learned that i did notappreciate when i was a founderis thatthe maker schedule vibe works for salesand talking to customers tooand scheduling 20 minute blocks to talkto customersis not the same as an eight-hourlikelike even if it's not literally yourprogrammerusing the maker's concept to apply tothe things that are the main event ofyour startup at any one time and formany folks that is sales yes yeah youshould be scheduling eight-hour blockslike if you're if you're if your job isthe co-founder is to be doing salesand it's like a couple of slivers inbetween other things on your schedulei don't think that's gonna go wellyou know right it's interesting i agreewith you it's basically this idea of getall of this stupid crapso productive that you can clear outthat every founder can clear out a chunkof their time for the make your scheduleand like some founders gonna have to domore of thisnon-development blocking tackling othersare gonna have to do less of it buti completely agree with you like it'sreally hard to get anything at a highlevel done in 20 minute blockslet's talk though about the opposite ofall these things right soyou know the premise of this chat is howfuture billionaires get donelet's talk about what we seegreat founders not dowhat comes to mind daltonwhat are founders avoiding look i thinkthe trickiest thing for everybodyis social media it's like a social mediais the black hole for time yes and youknow we're all guilty of it too likeit's addictive and so what's trickyis how to have a healthy relationshipwith social mediaso that you aren't spending 24 7 payingattention to who the main character ontwitter is that said something dumb andeveryone's like making fun of them it'sso hard not to do that constantly andit's also not hard to think that likeyou are a startup founder and you'resucceeding and you like did wellbut if i actually if like a like ahidden camera was shadowing you throughthe day it was like you just readtwitter all dayyou know what i'm saying like imagine ifthere was like a hidden camera auditingwhat people actually did with a lot oftheir timei think some people out there would bepretty embarrassed if there was a fullclear-eyed accounting of where theirtime went so okay discordhere umtechcrunch here twitter here you knowit's like how much time are you actuallyspending on not those thingsyou know it's hard man i had a twitterproblemand you know one of the things that irealized is thatsometimes willpower isn't enough youknow like what i did was i followunfollowed everyone on twitterand then i installed this like chromeapp that basically disables like threequarters of twitter's featuresand i was just you know it was like thisis an addictive thing i need aninterventionand that did it like that kind of killedmy twitter because it was just like ohwell and it was funny because for awhile twitter kept on trying to feed meinteresting articles and interestingstuff but it wasthey couldn't really do it because i wasnot following anyone i wasn't reallyinteracting with many tweets and soeventually just likeit broke but yeah i mean i i uninstalledfacebook years ago so i don't have it idon't have notification turns on i don'thave the twitter app installed on myphoneso again likeeveryone should do what works for thembuti'mpeople that actually are superproductivedo abnormal things to turn all this crapoff yeah isn't that like you have tolikeaggressively be abnormalon protecting your time yes because ifyou don't the world is going to stealyour time from you it's going to stealyour energy from youand likethat's a bad trade-off if you're astartup founder man yeah what a waste oftimeyou know it's funny it's like it'salmost like these two sets of toolsthere's one set of toolsthat allow you to organize your timebetter and there's another set of toolsthat protect your time andyeah effective people use bothconstantly and i think ineffectivepeople sometimes are mistaken and theythinkif i were just had a stronger will ilike needing tools is the problemlike successful people are just have astronger will and that's like not trueit's like no success people reach fortools all the timelike successful people recognize theirweaknesses and actually reach for toolsnow here's the one that comes up a lotthe collecting ofmentors advisors weird credentials likeadvice oh i went throughthree different accelerators and an idealab oh my advisory board i'm building myadvisory boardwhy do you think founders are attractedto that versus just building somethingand launching it it smells like you'redoing successful startup stuff you'relike part of the community of startupthis and you know like there's all thisstuff you can do andi'm not saying like it's all bad butit'sit's a bottomless pit of time suck likeyou could go so far deep in thereyou could be in that bottomless pit foryearsand be a startup founder that's neverbuilt a product and has never gotten asingle customer because you just cycledin and out of various forms of startupmentorshipit's weird it's like going to hollywoodand getting acting lessonsyes and like you just you you're in likethis acting lessons mode for like yearsand you're like yeah i'm an actor andit's like you know what i'm saying likeit feels like you're making progressright but you're notyou know i think a lot of it also has todo with founders being a little bitafraid and thinking these things do riskwell if i have an advisory board it'sgoing to de-risk my startup it's a bunchof smart people saying my idea is goodor if i do a bunch of mentorship itde-risks my startup i get a lot ofadvice andi don't know the thing we keep on sayingover and over again is like the twothings that reallyridiculously de-risk your startup threethings and we'll get to the third onethe second first one's talking yourcustomers the second one is building alaunching product like and it's like godforbid you're doing anythingmore than you're doing those things youare not taking the optimal de-riskstrategy likeum and then the last onewe see a lot of people trying to hedgetheir betsso many people trying to be like welli'm keeping grad school openi've got a google job offer i've got ajane street or whatever the newtech finance thingof the minute isand i'm talking to three friends aboutdoing a startupand like i'm kind of moving all thosepieces down the board at the same timeand like we get asked questions likeokay so how do i optimize this i'm likei don't i don't think you can be greatat those four things at the same timelike it's hard enough to be great at oneof those thingsbut like once again like why should ihave like why shouldn't i hedge deltonlike isn't the optimal move to hedgelike how do i know making the rightdecisionwhen you're taking a high risklife decisiona lot you know like we said again likewe said on these this video series nevertimes you're going to look stupid andyou're going to take risk and there's achanceyou're going to be like that was a hugemistakeandyou want to like barter with theuniverse you wanna you wanna be likecome on can ican't i likedo you risk this like you wanna thinkthat you can be smarter than the systemto somehow give up nothing and have nodownside and only have upsideand theyeah the more you want to try to barterwith the universe to be like okay firsti'll get a job at google and i'll savemoney and then i'll do you know i'llinvest in crypto and then i'll do likeyou want to like barter with theuniverse to have no riskand i guess likei get where i feel i get where peopleare coming from i just i'm not surethat's a real thing and i think it'sbeing more real with yourself is likeyeah i'm taking risks like yeah quittingmy job at google is a risk and this imay regret itbut i may not and but i'm doing thiswith eyes wide openand by actually putting my full heartinto anything i do whatever that isincluding not quitting my jobthat's how can you have regrets aboutthat being proud of the work you do imean this is what i tell a lot of folksi do a lot of office hours of peoplethat are shutting down i did one todayyou know it's like their final officehours because they're showing anotherstartup but i i tend to tell peoplesimilar stuff which is like lookif you're proud of the job you didyou know if you if you had a heart andyou gave it your alland you feel like you learned stuff thengreat job and you should view this as anaffirmative experience you didn't and solike i'm proud of you i'm proud of thejob you did i know you had your heartinto this thing and likewe'll get the next oneyou know i think that that message hasto be told becauseit is rewardingbut founders have to be kind of remindedthat they didn't fail like it's not likeor let's just put it this way it's notlike failing a test that like uh a basicmath test that you just didn't study forit's like it's not like that likeyou tried to do something that so fewpeople in the world are successful atfailing is not really failinglike at allit's likeit's like trying to be a pro athletelike you're really good in college youtry to go pro and you like make a teamand then you get cut in the first yearlike that's still pretty awesome yeahyou still were really one of the bestthousand people on earth who could playbasketballyeah and so it's likeyou know again it would be great if youwere number one in the world but likepeople are gonna respect what you didand you and if you if you're if you'reproud in your heart of the work you didthen you will view this as a positivething in your life you knowyeahand i always tell the people who arehedging i always say this the other sideyou know in our world it's reallycompetitive and what happens if there'sa team that's exactlyas competent as youand they're not hedgingthey're always going to winyou know they're always going to beatyou so how much better do you have to bethan that teamif you're splitting your resources twoways three ways four ways likeso it's not even a good strategy even ifyou were trying to think strategicallyunfortunately no umso yeahso there you gothose are some of the things that futurebillionaires do to get done andsome of the things that they avoid aswell great chatbotsounds good thanks man[Music][Music]you

Video script foreign[Music]it's been called the Harvard of SiliconValley Y combinator is perhaps the mostprestigious startup incubator in theworld it's funded more than 700companies to date including DropboxAirbnb and stripe but behind the startupmachine is a couple with their ownstartup Story how did they build Ycombinator into what it is today joiningme today on this edition of Studio 1.0why combinator Founders and husband andwife Paul Graham and Jessica Livingstonthank you so much for joining us thankyou great to have you so Paul it's beenwhat like six months since you steppeddown from the helm about that yeah ofwhy combinator how's it going oh it's sogreat I wish I had done it two yearsbefore why it was so hard Running Ycombinator I mean I'm not really anadministrator and YC had gotten kind ofbig suddenly I was running this bigthing and I was never suited to it yousaid you would you would you would bringback did you get your brain backyes you're still doing office hours Ihad this afternoon I had the bestconversation with the founder that Ihave ever had I had lunch with PatrickCollison found her stripe 100 of theconversation was about giant take overthe world ambitious plans and that islike the best possible office hours howinvolved are you guysI'm still very much involved I'm doingall the same things that I used to do ifif not engaged in different things Imiss working with Paul but I also loveworking with Sam Altman now Sam wasactually the founder of one of your veryfirst companies yeah looped when youstepped down there were certainly peopleout there who saidhe's not cut out to be you it's a goodthing he's not cut out to be me becauseI was not cut out to run something asbig as Y combinator is now he is betterthan me at this come on I was good atgiving advice to Founders is Sam gonnabe better than PG well they're going tobe differentum Sam brings a lot of things to thetable that that neither of us had whichis just this amazing amount of energyand patience that's needed to brokerdeals with investors why combinator isdoing a lot of different things as aresult I want to talk a little bit abouteach of you and where you came fromwhere you grew up your parents my familycame here from England when I was threeand a half and we lived in Pittsburghbecause my father worked in the nuclearbusiness when you designed a nuclearreactor he was the one who would figureout if it was going to explode so whatkind of kid were you I was a bad kidhalf the kids in my neighborhood wereforbidden to play with me what did youdo I was just always always getting introuble with everybody just constantlyI was suspended from schoolI thinkat least once every year from like firstgrade toto 12th grade and then at a certainpoint you got into computers did thathelp they really didn't teach peoplecomputers in school it was something youdid over you did off on the side so whendid you start coding uh I think when Iwas 15 on an IBM 1401 with 12K ofmagnetic core memory and then you wenton to Harvard to get your PhD yeah incomputer science but you also took artclasses on the side it was a verydisorganized trajectory I never knewwhat I was trying to do and it wasalways a mess of like random accidentsJessica what about you well I grew upoutside of Boston and I was an angelumI grew up with my father and mygrandmother his motherhad a very happy childhood and Friendswanted to play with meI knew I like to write but I had no ideawhat I wanted to be or what I wanted todo I know ultimately you ended up at aboutique Investment Bank were youtechnical did you ever learn how to codeI never learned to code and I'm nottechnical in the least someday when Iretire from my combinator I'm going tolearn to code but I was interested in itnow Paul before y commentator youstarted another company tell me aboutvia webthe idea at the time was quiterevolutionary well the reason thecompany was called via web is that thesoftware worked via the web right it waswhat is now known as a web appum and it was it was the first one itwas an online store Builder got boughtby Yahoo and eventually became still isYahoo's tour what was it like working atYahoo how long did you last there theguy who got suspended every year I wasbasically getting suspended from Yahootoo I hereby apologize to all the peopleI have ever worked for so I like barelylasted a year and you went on to writeyou started writing essays atpaulgram.com yeah and that's when youstarted building your following Isuppose so I didn't really think I wasbuilding what were you writing aboutI started just writing about softwarethen I gradually realized that no onewould come and drag me away if I startedwriting about other things too at whatpoint did you guys meetwe met at a party at Paul's house inCambridge that I almost didn't attend somy combinator almost didn't exist italways didn't exist it's scary how closeit was yes how did you come up with theidea for a y combinator well Jessica waswas very interested in startups she waswriting a book that was the I read whenI moved to Silicon Valley really you'renever tired of hearing stories like thatit was really hard to find anyinformation on startups and I was sofascinated by all the stories that Iheard from these guys and then you gavethe talk at Harvard yeah about thatbecame the essay how to start a startupone of the things I told them was thatthey should raise money from people whohad gotten the money from starting astartup because then they could getadvice they were all looking at meexpectantly like baby birds looking attheir mother wanting to feed them butthen afterwards I felt sort of badbecause I had always thought I was goingto do some Angel investment I stillhadn't gotten around to it because Ididn't know how I thought all right I'lldo it I'll do it I'll finally startdoing some Angel Investing it was notsupposed to grow into this big thingthis is one of the things we tellFounders so often the best way to starta startup that's really going to takeover the world is don't even try tostart a startup just try and start aproject that you think would be cool towork on and YC was an instance of thishow did you come up with the name ycombinator the original name wasCambridge seed yeah but then we thoughtI mean it's a cool name we were inCambridge but it was too tied to oneplace the Y combinator is a trick theLambda calculus which is a formallanguage for expressing algorithms it'sa math a math concept basically how didyou guys decide to work together on thisbecause you weren't married yet butthat's a big decision it was it was verythat was it was scary because we hadonly been dating for a year[Music][Music]there are myths about so many of theGreat companies startups Founders thatare boiled down into Legend and what isthe myth of Y combinator and what is thereality people just do not realize howlike not interested we were in makingmoney I'm thinking of all these peoplesaying on forums oh it's so self-servingbut honestly in the beginning we werenot trying to make money it was all anexperiment to see if these like newideascould work a lot of people think of itas Paul Graham's y combinator oh there'sa myth there's a really big myth you'vecalled Jessica the secret weapon likenothing has ever happened a y combinatorthat Jessica did not like set her sealof approval on right there is shebasically has veto over everything andthis is the first time that you guyshave been interviewed together yeah Ican't believe that well let's face itI'm not as interesting as you I don'tmake colorful remarks and I've chosen tobe behind the scenes I'm morecomfortable behind the scenes I likerunning things this is why she is thesecret weaponshe is one of these people who hasPerfect Pitch for charactershe can talk to somebody and fairlyquickly tell whether they're a goodperson or not so tell me about the firstclasseight companies but you didn't know ifanyone was gonnaeven apply right right we we had no ideaif people were going to apply and we hadlike a few hundred applications the mostcritical Innovation with the YC model isto fund a bunch of startups at once soit's better for the investor but alsobetter for the startups because theyhave colleagues that is the big thingyou're missing in a startup it's solonely and now it's like it has some ofthe advantages being part of a companywithout the disadvantages at what pointdid you decide to take money frominvestors because obviously you had whenwe had things about VCS no we had tofrankly I ran out of money and it takesI mean how long does it take we don'teven know yet how long it takes for thebig exits but like 10 years maybe you'regoing into your 19thfunding cycle mm-hmmwhat do you consider the most successfulYC companies it is pretty much the oneswith the high valuations the three withthe highest valuations or Airbnb Dropboxand Stripes did you know early on thatthere were going to be hitswe knew the founders were good what wasit aboutDrew house did and Brian cheskywhat was it about them that it wasdifferent things yeah it was differentthings about the two of them in Drew'scase he was the guy who could write thissoftware Dropbox succeeded by solving analmost impossibly hard problem whereasAirbnb is different Airbnb is like thismass movement where everyone's stayingin other people's houses worldwide wewere skeptical though I just rememberthinking I don't really care what theidea is these Founders are awesome we'refunding them Patrick Collison fromstripe I have known since he was like14. back when he was this high schoolkid in Ireland he used to email mequestions about the lisp programminglanguage and I had no idea he was a kidnow that these companies are worthmulti-billions of dollars when you lookback if they had had the opportunitywould they have sold almost everyone ifsomeone came along with a big enoughoffer at the right moment would havetaken it we do know with Drew actuallybecause in the Y combinator applicationearly on we used to ask if someone camealong offered you money for your companyright after YC what's the least youwould take I think Drew answered amillion dollars so it's reallyconvenient for everyone involved that noone wanted to buy Dropbox early on nowthat you've been doing this for so manyyears can you identify the future DrewHouston's and Brian chesky's the futuredrop boxes and airbnbs earliersooner than everybody else we might beable to identify them better than otherpeople but there are limits to how wellyou can identify them there's a gooddeal of luck if you had to boil it downinto one word what you're looking forit's authentic you're looking for peoplewho are real friends not just people whogot together for purposes of thisstartup you don't want people who arejust in it for the money zuck's not init for the money he never was and thatwas why he turned down the Yahooacquisition offer and without havingdone that he would never Facebookwouldn't be what it is today how has theinterview process evolved we firststarted out was it 40 minutes I think itwas 40 minute interviews and now withthe 10-minute interviews we really don'thave like a pitch how can you reallyknow in 10 minutesyou can't know for sure here's aninteresting test after each minute Howlikely are you to change your mind ifyou had another 10 minutes you mightonly change your mind two percent of thetime what is the average valuation ofall the YC companies I know uh whattheir valuation is it just crossed 30billion what's your stake in theall the money is in the few big hitsright and so you have to ask whatpercentage do you end up with a few bighits after dilution and we assume it'llend up being like three percentsomething like that so three percent ofthirty see I've literally I've neverdone this calculation 900 million butuntil you asked me that I had neveractually multiplied those numberstogether an article was written recentlythat Sequoia has made more money on ycombinator than y combinator has yeahstrictly speaking I believe more of that30 billion dollars worth of equitybelongs to Sequoia than us and yourpolicy is that you don't make follow-oninvestments rightwould you ever consider changing thatpolicy in order to make money off thehits that you picked we never say neverbut the problem with that Emily is thatthere's a signaling thing right um andso if we're to do follow-on Investmentswe're telling other investors who webelieve are going to be the best andthat would hurt the founders who areprobably great investment opportunitiesbut we just didn't choose to do afollow-on in does it bother you thatSequoia has made more money than youhave no who cares I'm happy for them Ireally like Sequoia why combinator hasgotten so much praise but also a lot ofcriticism why do you think it's socontroversial one of the most surprisingthings I realized as why why combinatorbecame more successful is that the morefamous Something becomes the more peoplewant to attack it it's always been amystery to me though because honestlyevery night I go to sleep I think youknow did we help the founders today andthe answer is almost always Yes actuallyshe goes to bed at night and she sayswhat is everyone's saying all these meanthings about us that's so not trueyou've said that other investors havetried to stab you in the backdo you think they're are they jealousthere have been some some things thatyou just can't believe someone's goingto do that to youum I don't know why they I mean it'sprobably boils down to money and power Idon't know one thing that people havesaid to me is that well YC has investedin over 700 companies there's only ahandful of hits is that a good trackrecord you either have a couple hits orno hits those are the only two optionsright so yes ryc companies overvaluedmaybe maybe all startups are and so I'veheard investors claiming that startupthe YC startups at demo day are like 2Xovervalued and that is the greatestcompliment that means we can take peopleinto YC and even if we did nothing elsethey would be able to get twice thevaluation they would have otherwise butis that a good thing if the company isnot really worth that if it's worth alot then it was a bargain anyway even ifit was overpriced now something elsethat you've been in I know this issomething that Jessica has thought a lotabout is not admitting enough women isthat true we don't have enough womenapplying which is what we're reallymaking an effort now on incur on tryingto dowe we don't ask on the application whatsomeone's gender is we're trying to getthe word out there that that more womenshould be starting startups we've hosteda female Founders conference that we'regoing to do again this winter where webring you know successful femaleFounders and tell their stories to toinspire more women some of the wordspeople use are harsh I mean they'vecalled y combinator a frat house howmany women have you fundedin the past it was usually around fourpercent of the founders in the batcheswere female and now it's more like 12and obviously that's not where weideally want to be but it's moving inthe right direction how do we get morewomen founding women who are Larry andSergey examples are what makes everyonewant to start startups how have youchanged the interview process in subtleways to make sure you are getting thebest people that you're notdiscriminating that everyone has anequal shot well one thing that's changedrecently is that we have a femalepartner in every one of the interviewrooms why not completely blind screeneveryone can you tell if they weretelling the truth then then I couldn'tobserve their interaction[Music]you've got two kidswhat kind of parents are youPaul is the best father I've ever met II'm going to say that because youwouldn't say that yourself he spends somuch time with them teaching them thingsexposing them to things things that I'verarely seen a lot of other fathers doso I lucked outnow how do you manage being married andbeingcolleaguesit always worked really well it wasreally easy we never disagreed onanything really I think have you everthought about y combinatorthink so no noum I don't believe it it's really trueit's really true and the secret is thesame secret that's true for co-foundersin general which is you have differentresponsibilities right each person is incharge of their own thing and they'reexperts in that thing what is thehottest why combinator company that wedon't know about yet boosted boards why boosted boardslet's just say they have biggerAmbitions than making skateboardswhat is the biggest fire you've had toput out a startup I put out fires atleast one a week of co-founder disputesthat and fundraising interactions withinvestors and investors maltreating thestartups we intervene but can you thinkhow do you intervene like how do youprotecta startup from its own investors at thispoint you don't have to like makeexplicit threats right you just sort ofsay come on guys be niceum but the investors know that behindthe come on guys be nice is if you don'twe won't send any more startups to youand if you don't all of the Y combinatorFounders will know about it like thenext day the next day biggest regretit's a bit Grim butum it's very it's very easy for me tosay now what my biggest mistake isI can answer I'll do my answermy biggest regret is I kind ofsquandered my college education I didn'tlearn as many things as I could learn orwork as hard as I I could have and Ialways you know compare myself to thefounders we fund who are doing so manyum interesting and ambitious things andI think I kind of like squandered alittle bit of my youth Paulum I have to say it very carefully so Ican remain in control of myself butumremind your parents to be screened forcolon cancerI understand my father passed away thereare many things that I would like totell him yeah and do for him coloncancer man it's justif they catch it early it's sopreventable you know you gotta remind meto make him go get screenedso what is next I mean is is YCor will there be a second for call actfrom Paul and Jessica I am like fullyjust as enthusiastic about whycombinator as I was the day we gotstarted if not more so we're doing somany exciting things it actually seemslike a good idea how about you PaulI'm going to go back to writing that'swhat I was doing before Y combinator andthat's what I always was hoping to dohow do you guys want YC to be rememberedyou know I don't want YC to beremembered I want it to still existright I want YC to be like thisinstitution that persists for a longtime it could last a lot longer than acom than a product company does becausestructurally it's more like a universityit could in principle last for hundredsof years I wanted to be remembered aschanging a lot of people's livesum and and hopefully making the world alittle bit of a better place Paul Grahamand Jessica Livingston

able to release stored energy atwill to keep ourselves warm fend offpredators and cook food that hadpreviously been too difficult to digesteventually we figured out how to harnessthe energy of other animals withoutfirst sticking a spit through them byputting them to work in our fields andusing them for transportationwe learned how to capture the energy ofthe wind in ships sails enabling us tocross oceans and colonized the worldat some point a bright spark realizedthe water running downhill generatedenergy we could use through water wheelsto grind our grain and power saw andtextile millsnext we got our heads around steam powerwhich catalyzed the industrialrevolutionand these days we extract hugequantities of fossil fuels from beneaththe earth to light our homes and powerour carsthese different ways of generatingenergy are so diverseit's easy to forget they all come from acommon sourcethe sunwhen sunlight shines on the earth someis captured and converted into chemicalenergy by plantsby eating or burning those plants we'resimply converting that energy into aform we can readily use whether fornutrition heat or just to get highfossil fuels those incredibly convenientbut annoyingly environmentallyunfriendly sources of energy that somuch of our modern worlds depends onare nothing more than the remains ofplants and animals deposited overmillions of yearseven water wheels and ship sales areultimately powered by solar energyliquid water only exists here on earthin the first place thanks to heat fromthe sun which also causes water toevaporate rise into the atmosphere andfall back to earth as rainthe mechanical energy of water rushingdownhill in streams and rivers thatpowers the humble water wheel isessentially stored energy from sunlightthe same is true for wind energy whichis created by differences in airtemperature and density that form as thesun warms the ground to varying degreesit isn't quite true to say all theenergy we use here on earth comesdirectly from the sunicelandic favorite geothermal energy isderived from forces at play during theformation of the planet and the decay ofradioactive particles in the earth'scorenuclear energy comes from splittingatoms and tidal energy is created by theinterplay of gravity between the earthsun and moonbut at least for now they make up asmall percentage of the total energy weuse with energy generated by sunlightbeing dominantas our civilization continues to growmore advancedour energy needs will increasethat's partly because there'll simply bemore of us almost 10 billion by 2050according to current estimationsand partly because the things we dorequire more energy with every passingyearwith our computers tablets and mobilephones we're all using more energy moreof the time and as a society we're usingour ever-increasing technologicalcapabilitiesto make some seriously power-hungry toystake fugaku which sounds like a kind ofsushi but it's actually the world'sfastest supercomputerit uses enough energy to power 20 000homes when pushed to its prodigiouslimitsthen there's the large hadron colliderat cern in switzerland which has anannual energy consumption equivalent tothat used by three hundred thousandhomesin the last two hundred years or so thetotal energy consumption of mankind hasincreased almost two thousand fivehundred percentcompared to a population increase ofabout seven hundred percentand we're showing no signs of slowingthis trends down anytime soon butthere's a problemthe energy available to us here on earthis not an infinite resourceand sooner or laterwe're going to start running outearth overshoot day is calculated as thedate each yearwhen humanity's resource consumptionexceeds the levels the earth is capableof regenerating the following yearit isn't an exact science but it's agood illustration of how much we'reeating into unsustainable reserves ofthings like fossil fuels think of itlike a doomsday clock but for keyresources instead of the totalannihilation of mankind when it wasfirst calculated in 1987earth overshoot day landed on the 23rdof octobersince then the date has been steadilycreeping forward each year andin 2019overshoot day came at the end of july inshort our energy needs are rapidlyincreasing whilst our energy reservesare slowly decreasingthis means at some point in the futurethere's going to come a time when theenergy available to us here on earthsimply isn't going to cut it anymoreso what happens thenwell it just so happens that in 1960 aman named freeman dyson asked himselfthat very same question and theconclusion he came to was bothstartlingly ambitious and incrediblysimple instead of collecting our star'senergy second hand in the form of fossilfuels or wind powerwe just cut out the middleman andharvest all the energy we need directlyfrom the sun and that's exactly what youcan do in stellaris galaxy commandwho've kindly sponsored this video itell you i've been absolutely glued

200 credits don't missthis one guysnow you might be picturing mile uponmile of solar panels in some dustydesert here on planet earth at thispoint but the thing is only a tinyfraction of the total energy produced bythe sun ever comes our waystars are after all spherical and theyradiate energy pretty much equally inall directionsmeaning any earthbound solar panels nomatter how large and efficientwill never come close to tapping theentirety of the sun's total energyoutputif we want to do that dyson realizedwe're going to need to get a hell of alot closer and build something muchmuch biggerthe technology he conceived to harvestall of the sun's energy is today knownas a dyson spherea megastructure that would completelyencompass the sun inside a giant shellnowfair warning we're about to enter thatstrange grey area that exists betweenscience fiction and science future herecurrent estimates suggest we won't becapable of building such a structure fora few thousand years yetbut some scientists believe dyson'sfears of some variety are a logicalperhaps even inevitable step in thetechnological evolution of any advancedcivilization the kind of dyson spheremost often depicted is a solidshell-like megastructure that completelyenvelops its starwith the interior surface lined withsolar panels that would absorb 100 ofthe total energy output of that starwhich is about 385 yatta watts in thecase of the sunokay so a yottawatt sounds kind of madeup but to put that figure intoperspective it's about 22 trillion timeshumanity's total power consumption todaythat means if we were to imagine everysingle one of the 250 billion stars inour galaxy was home to an advancedcivilization with equivalent energyneeds to our owna single dyson sphere surrounding oursun would provide enough energy to powerall of them indefinitely in fact even ifwe added a trillion civilizations fromthe stars of our neighboring galaxyandromeda into the mix our solitarydyson sphere would still have enoughenergy to power every single one of themwithout even breaking a sweateverlasting energy with enough left overto lend to the neighbors sign me upthe problem is even as far ashypothesized solar megastructures go adyson sphere would be kinda tricky tobuildthe radius of these theoretical spheresis typically assumed to be oneastronomical unitthat's about the distance between theearth and the sun with the idea beingthat sunlight hitting the interior ofthe dyson sphere would be of the sameintensity as we're used to here on earthmeaning we could happily live on it butlet's take a second to think about howridiculously big this thing would bewe're talking a colossal sphere with aradius of 93 million miles completelyencircling the sun not to mentionencompassing the orbits of mercury andvenussuch a megastructure would have asurface area about 550 million timeslarger than that of earth assuming weare able to make the whole interiorsurface habitable which would requireovercoming several technical challengesthat we won't even get into here andthat we spread everyone out with asimilar population density to that whichwe currently have on earththere would be room for almost fourquadrillion people to live there if youwanted to take a road trip around theequator to take in the sights eventraveling at 100 miles per hour non-stopin your fancy car of the futureit would take you almost 700 years toget back to where you started hell eventraveling at the speed of light it wouldtake you almost an hour so yeah thisthing would be on the large sideso large in fact that we would have toliterally dismantle every single planetin our solar system just to get ourhands on enough raw materials to builditputting aside the morality of destroyingthe solar system in our endless hunt forenergyi mean we're basically doing the samething here on earth so i'm sure we'llget over it when the time comeseven if we tore up all the planetsincluding the gas giantswe would only have enough materials tomake a dyson sphere between 8 and 20centimeters thick depending on thedensity of the outer shell oh andspeaking of materialsas of today no building material knownto man would even come close to beingstrong enough it's also worth mentioningthat something this big would be anabsolute asteroid magnet so we're almostcertainly going to have to install ascreen protector right out of the boxnow you might be wondering what exactlywe would do with 22 trillion times asmuch energy as we need right nowand that's a fairly good questionfirst up we'll naturally have greatlyincreased energy needs by the time we'retechnologically advanced enough toactually build a dyson sphere so we'llbe able to power all that lovely futuretech no problem i'm sure the ps5 millionis going to be quite the energy hog buteven taking that into account it'slikely we're going to have a little bitof headroom scientists science fictionauthors and under-qualified youtubershave all spent time pondering just whatthe human race could do withnear-limitless energyand it turns out the possibilities arewell near limitlessit's even been theorized we could usedyson sphere-like megastructures assolar system scale engines designed tocomplete specific tasksone such engine known as a matriascabrain would use a series of nested dysonspheres to funnel the total energeticoutput of its parent startowards one single purposecomputationsome people have hypothesized that asolar system-sized computer drawing onthis much energywould have the capability to challengethe very laws underpinning our universewhilst others have theorized that itwould almost certainly be able to runcrisisprobably the most popular hypothesis isthat a matriarchal brain will be able torun perfect simulations of human mindsinside entire virtual worlds perhapseven universes allowing us if we wantedto to digitize the entire human racemaking ourselves an entirely new andeffectively immortal species in theprocess who knows we may even be livinginside the memory banks of a matriarchalbrain right nowokay so all this is really interestingand everything but why should we carei mean even if dyson's fears really arethe inevitable energetic evolution ofmankind none of us are ever going tocome close to seeing one these thingswon't be built by humans for thousandsof years and cryogenic freezing isprobably not to mentionobscenely expensiveso we'll all be long dead by thenbutit turns out dyson spheres are actuallyextremely relevant to the human raceright now not because we have asnowflakes chance in hell of buildingone anytime soon but because someoneelsemight if you've watched my video on whywe haven't found aliens yetyou'll know one of the biggestchallenges facing our hunt forextraterrestrial life is the franklyinconvenient size of the universe thereare so many places to look and all ofthem are so damn far away that searchingfor alien life out there is a bit likestaring up into the night sky in thehopes of spotting a gnat wearing theworld's tiniest spacesuit buzzing aroundthe moonmost of our efforts to find aliens focuson radio waves because they're prettygood at penetrating our atmosphere andbecause we know alien technology mightproduce them for the simple reason thatours already does but even with some ofthe most powerful radio antennas on theplanet the kind of radio leakage fromour own transmissions here on earthwould only be detectable a few lightyears away which is less than thedistance to our nearest star proximacentauriand that's where dyson's fears come inbecause if other civilizations havealready built themwe should be able to track them down andfrom potentiallygalaxy spanning distanceswhilst the sphere itself probablywouldn't be visible to usthe waste radiation emitted by a dysonsphere probably would be as it wouldlook very very different to most otherstarsbeing heavily weighted towards theinfrared end of the spectrum this wasactually the point of freeman dyson'slittle thought experiment in the firstplace by the way he wasn't trying tohelp mankind solve its future energywoes he was brainstorming ways to trackdown other intelligent civilizations inthe endless reaches of spacescience is taking the possibility ofdetecting dyson spheres seriously withseti incorporating dyson's assumptionsinto their search criteria and fermilabin the u.s conducting their own searchbased on data from an infrared specificspace telescope known as irisfor a couple of months back in 2015 weeven thought we'd found a dyson spherearound what is now known as tabby's starin the constellation cygnusamateur astronomers noticed that tabby'sstar appeared to have significantlydimmed in the space of a single daysuggesting something large was somehowobscuring part of the starsmall fluctuations in a star'sluminosity aren't uncommonbut this was no small fluctuation aplanet the size of jupiter passing infront of a star of this size wouldreduce its luminosity by about onepercentbuttabby's starappeared to have dimmed by a staggering22 percentclearly whatever was obscuring it wasbigvery biga half-built dyson sphere perhapsscientists were starting to get prettyexcited by this point and telescopesaround the world were trained on thecygnus constellation where tabby's starcontinued to display unusual behaviorand what exactly was causing tabby'sstar to dim like some kind of stellardisco ballthe truth is we still aren't quite surebut sadly whilst there was genuine hopethis might have been humanity's firstsight of extraterrestrials and alienmegastructure seems to have fallen along way down the pecking order in termsof potential hypotheseswith some kind of unusual ultra finedust cloud apparently the most likelyexplanation so the search goes on andunfortunately that may well be the casefor some time yetthe trouble is in reality a dyson's fearis unlikely to be a solidall-encompassing shell at allinstead it will probably be made up of amass of individual satellites commonlyin what is known as a dyson swarm thiskind of megastructure probably wouldn'tbe able to tap into a hundred percent ofthe star's energybut it would be far more practical toactually build than a shell ever couldbe it would need far fewer resourceswould be immeasurably simpler toconstruct and would be more asteroidproof and it could more easily be builtin stages over a period of hundreds eventhousands of years the problem from ourperspective is whilst the dyson swarmwould still dim the star around which itwas built the effect would be far lessdramatic than it would be with a dysonshellmeaning we would be unlikely to be ableto detect one with our currenttechnology although if we're completelyhonest that might not be such a terriblethingafter all any civilization capable ofbuilding a dyson sphere would be muchmuch more advanced than we are and itmight just be for the best if we don'tbump into each otherfor a good while yet in some ways tryingto track down civilizations with theirknow how to build a dyson sphereis a little bit like a tiny fishswimming around a vast ocean in the hopeof bumping into the megalodonfinding one would certainly be

Video script Human history is told by the energy we use. At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus.At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species.Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.At that stage we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will requireungodly amounts of energy.Luckily, we know where to find it. The Sun - the ultimate source of energy.A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.So, how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it.If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest mostambitious structure in the universe.The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species. It would usher in an age of exploration andexpansion on a scale we can barely imagine.So, what would it look like?Solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go a large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impactspossibly shattering it would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun aMore, viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power andbeam it elsewheresuch as sward would give humanity basically unlimited energy but building it won't be easythe Sun is very big so we need a lot of satellites ifEach satellite is a square kilometer we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Suneven if they're built as lightly as possible we need about 100 quintillion tons of material andThen we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun ontop of all that we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start buildinglet's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the mega structureWe can sort the challenges into three main categoriesmaterials design and energyTo get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planetOf the planets available mercury is the best candidate it's the closest to the Sun and very metal-richclose to the SunalsoMeans less moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth making itcomparatively easy to launch material into spaceNext we should consider the design of our swarm simpler is betterConventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention forastronomically long times and they need to be cheap to produceBut they're most likely going to be enormous mirrorswhich refocus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated solar power on earthto build and launch them efficiently they must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal full bound to some supports andLast we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself taking a part of planets and launching things into spacerequires an enormous amount of energy for example if we used all the fossil fuels andUranium on earth and we?Were perfectly efficient we could only launch as muchMass as Mount Everest into space a rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassemblyTo get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a dyson sphereBut that's. Ok there's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury so let's get to workHumans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environmentSo, we'd want to automate as much as possibleIdeally we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual workThere are four major pieces of technology required solar collectors miners refiners and launch equipmentthe solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planetTo start maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them either as mirrors or as traditional solar panelsthey'll provide the energy to run our miners which strip-mine the surface of the planet and our refiners which extract valuable elements andfabricate them into our swarm satellitesto get them into space we need a creative and efficient solutionRockets aren't too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuseInstead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun a longerElectromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speedsOur swarm satellites will be packed tight for launch unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbitfrom this point we can take advantage ofexponential growth using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and fastereach panel provides the energy to build another those to work together to build the next toFour become eight eight become 16 and so onwithin just about 60 doubling times the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels andThis can happen quickly if a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build we could be done in a decadeif only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energyEven collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species energy budgetWe could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projectscolonies on other worlds terraforming planetsconstructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars it could be the start of an interstellarCivilization based on physics alone this is not just possible but easyIt's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomersThink there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way we haven't spotted any yet but they could be thereit's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains andConflicts that will not matter in the long run but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselveswe could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star ifWe?

At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus.At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species.Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat,we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.At that stage we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will requireungodly amounts of energy.Luckily, we know where to find it. The Sun - the ultimate source of energy.A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.So, how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it.If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest mostambitious structure in the universe.The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species. It would usher in an age of exploration andexpansion on a scale we can barely imagine.So, what would it look like?Solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go a large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impactspossibly shattering it would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun aMore, viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power andbeam it elsewheresuch as sward would give humanity basically unlimited energy but building it won't be easythe Sun is very big so we need a lot of satellites ifEach satellite is a square kilometer we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Suneven if they're built as lightly as possible we need about 100 quintillion tons of material andThen we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun ontop of all that we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start buildinglet's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the mega structureWe can sort the challenges into three main categoriesmaterials design and energyTo get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planetOf the planets available mercury is the best candidate it's the closest to the Sun and very metal-richclose to the SunalsoMeans less moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth making itcomparatively easy to launch material into spaceNext we should consider the design of our swarm simpler is betterConventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention forastronomically long times and they need to be cheap to produceBut they're most likely going to be enormous mirrorswhich refocus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated solar power on earthto build and launch them efficiently they must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal full bound to some supports andLast we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself taking a part of planets and launching things into spacerequires an enormous amount of energy for example if we used all the fossil fuels andUranium on earth and we?Were perfectly efficient we could only launch as muchMass as Mount Everest into space a rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassemblyTo get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a dyson sphereBut that's. Ok there's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury so let's get to workHumans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environmentSo, we'd want to automate as much as possibleIdeally we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual workThere are four major pieces of technology required solar collectors miners refiners and launch equipmentthe solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planetTo start maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them either as mirrors or as traditional solar panelsthey'll provide the energy to run our miners which strip-mine the surface of the planet and our refiners which extract valuable elements andfabricate them into our swarm satellitesto get them into space we need a creative and efficient solutionRockets aren't too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuseInstead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun a longerElectromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speedsOur swarm satellites will be packed tight for launch unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbitfrom this point we can take advantage ofexponential growth using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and fastereach panel provides the energy to build another those to work together to build the next toFour become eight eight become 16 and so onwithin just about 60 doubling times the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels andThis can happen quickly if a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build we could be done in a decadeif only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energyEven collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species energy budgetWe could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projectscolonies on other worlds terraforming planetsconstructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars it could be the start of an interstellarCivilization based on physics alone this is not just possible but easyIt's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomersThink there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way we haven't spotted any yet but they could be thereit's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains andConflicts that will not matter in the long run but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselveswe could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star ifWe? Do it the only limitation left will be our ownimagination

Video script uh you are watching the context it istime for our regular weekly segment AI[Music]decoded yes welcome to AI decoded if youare a regular viewer of this programyou'll know by now that each week wedevote half an hour every Thursday tothe extraordinary advances in artificialintelligence and this week we took agiant step forward with the release ofchat GPT 40 which is significantlyeasier to operate it comes with audiovisual and text in real time an alwayshelpful always available humanlike robotto interact whenever you like do youworry about that look how obsessedpeople have become with Twitter andsocial media what if chat GPT replaceshuman interaction what if we become soobsessed with this new technology thatpeople would share their special momentswith a computer rather than you likethis man introducing his dog to his AIcompanion I want to introduce you tosomebody well hello there cutie what'syour name little sluff ball this isBowser well hello Bowser aren't you justthe most adorable little thing yeah lookat you enjoy this is one of his favoritethings todo oh I can see why look at that Focusfing balls is serious business forBowser yeah maybe no longer man's bestfriend let's take a look at how thepapers covered the release of chat GPT40 The Laughing chatting singing AI soresponsive says the guardian you couldalmost forget it's not a sentient beingyou could use it as a dating conciergethis week says the mail the founder ofdating out Bumble suggested we use ourcustomized AI to seek out the perfectpartner or maybe you don't need apartner if the AI is the super sexyrobot it's coming at you fast but who isholding the Reigns news this week fromaxio that s alman's open AI have shedthree of the doomers the more cautiousmembers of the board who'd been pushingthe safer and slower approach tonight wewill talk to the author of Human Rightsrobot wrongs lawyer Susan algra who haswritten extensively about the way AI isthreatening our rights in war sexpublishing and creativity and what wemight do to fight back there were twotriggers uh that SP spurred Susi algra'suh desire to write this book we willcome to that very shortly but with me uhin uh the studio tonight is Samir Samiris here to keep us company thank youvery much for being with us have you usechat GPT yeah I have and it's prettyimpressive I got to say um so the bigdifference is the model understands textand and uh video sound uh natively soit's almost like before there was a kindof like a translator between us and themodel and now that's gone so it's takingin more information and some of thethings that were lost uh in Translationare are now native to the model so it'sit's more expressive does he we'vetalked before aboutwhether it becomes it feels like asentient being could you have arelationship with this I think you canyeah you know and I personally you knowyou know me I'm I'm I'm an AI evangelistand I I think it's it's it's you know Ithink it's it's better that this guy isyou know on his uh showing showing thehis AI uh his his dog rather than sayyou know necessarily going on Tick Tockor something and and trying to getattention like that you know right butwhat about what about what he's teachingit where does that go I I mean is is isare the pictures that he'staking uh the things that he says tothis AI model are those being recordedEd by chat GPT yeah that's a goodquestion so they have different tiers sodepending on which tier you're on theykeep your data uh if you're on a freetier I believe they they can use it totrain their models you can opt out of itand then if you pay you they don't youknow train your models or if you're abusiness user they don't so therethere's there's options there but ofcourse it's a big question you knowwhere where is this going what are theydoing with it okay well let me introduceyou to Susie as I say there were therewere two reasons that you you you wrotethis book one was the sudden explosionof chat GPT which we're talking aboutand this narrative that everyoneovernight could be I don't know anovelist or a painter and then there wasanother story about this Belgian man whotook his own life after a six- weekintensive relationship with an AIchatbot um which which is the alarmingpart of this what what is it that mostconcerns you about where we're going Ithink what really concerns me and thisnews this week is really kind of theepto me of it is what is AI for is AI forreplacing humanity is it for replacinghuman connection and if that is whatit's for is that what we really want andthe case that you mentioned about theBelgian man who really tragically tookhis own life earlier this year afterjust 6 weeks relationship with a chatbotwhich was literally just texting orwriting into a computer it wasn't thischatting to a sexy flirty chat spot itwas literally justtexting he left behind a widow and twosmall children because he believed thathe wanted to be with his AI chatbot andthat she would provide the future tosave us from The Perils of climatechange you know it's really disturbingto think that people's minds can bemanipulated in that way so quicklythat's difficult to conceive withsomething you're having to text to andit texts back at you but if it's aconversation with someone who's voiceyou can change whose Avatar you can maketo look what like whatever you want youthen you can see why it would becomemore addictive absolutely and I wasreally quite surprised when I started tolook into it further to find how manymillions of people have signed up toservices to have ai relationships and AIcompanions which are effectively justchatbots with an avatar that you'vedesigned this ideal person and I thinkone of the big problems with it is thatif you insist on having a relationshipwith something you've created in thisperfect ideal how are you actually goingto deal with real people who areactually a bit complicated and maybedon't do what you want them to do wellI'm glad you asked that because one ofthe stories that we've focused on thisweek is this this comment from theBumble founder uh Whitney walf uh whitnewolf herd who said that the future ofdating could be filled with AI poweredpersonas setting each other up to helpwomen in their search for a connectionso the idea would be that this AI modelwould be like a concierge siftingthrough all these different profiles topick you the perfect partner and I thinkthat announcement is in one on one handa sort of sign that online dating has aproblem that there is definitely thatpeople are frustrated and not findingthe kind of human connection that theywant through online dating I mean if youcould use AI to filter out inappropriatemessages and block anyone who sends themmaybe that would be fantastic I'm notquite seeing howthis buiness to me because if you findthe perfect partner you're not on BumbleYou' already got your exactly exactlybut but but but what what we have herethough is another example of Technologybeing inserted into people's lives toreplace human connections humanrelationships andinteractions why do you think that isspecificallydangerous to socialcontrol I think it's about corporatecaptureof society of human societyand creating dependence as well I thinkmaking us you know separating us offfrom our friends and our loved onesisolating us effectively and making usemotionally psychologically andpractically dependent on what iseffectively a business model I think isreally worrying you know what happens ifyou switch off the electricity and thatwas one of the things with one of the umcompanies that run these AI chatbotrelationships replica when they werehaving problems with seeing sort ofabuse filtering through the system andthey closed down the possibility forsexting people were suddenly bereft ofthese relationships that they thoughtthey had which could just be switchedoff by a change in the business whathappens is the business goes bankruptand people are then left with nothingsort of been separated off from theirtheir social environments and I thinkthat's very worrying what I've alwayssaid with the premise of this program isthat we we we highlight the risks whichare considerable but we also show how itcan be used to great benefit so I wantto show you how chat GPT 40 has beenused to help someone who's blind have awatch is the king in Residence at themoment yes it looks like the king is inResidence right now the Royal Standardflag is flying above Buckingham Palacewhich is the signal that the Monarch ispresent how exciting to be there whilethe king is home try and tell me exactlywhat they're doing right now please umright now now the Ducks are gentlygliding across the water they're movingin a fairly relaxed manner not in ahurry occasionally one of them will dipits head under the water probablylooking for food and then pop backup I even know when a taxi is comingwith its orange light on I think I'llhail it to gethome yes I spotted one just now it'sheading you way on the left side of theroad get ready to wave itdown I mean that's pretty extraordinaryand and it shows how responsive it isbut I I listen to that voice and I justwant to turn to another chapter in yourfascinating book and it's about sexrobots and chat Bots which is which iswhere that the dangerous thing comes inyou you you when you look at this thisparticular demo that came from chat GPTthis week you can make it dramatic youcan make it serious you can make itsultry yeah and sexy um and that I thinkis where a lot of people might becomeconcerned I mean are we going to haveyoung men particularly in bedrooms whodon't interact with one another uh wholose the ability to communicate wellit's what we're seeing already as I sayeven just with the basic chat Bo this isreally just supercharging it um and Ithink when you look at use cases likethat that we've just seen you knowthat's fantastic but that doesn't meanthat you necessarily need it foreverything all the time everywhere and Ithink that's one of the problems we seewith the way AI is being rolled out iscreating dependencies and sort ofcreating social phenomena instead oflooking at discrete use cases um and Ithink the relationship question reallyis problematic and I think this is justyou know as I said looking at where weare already this I mean in in two yearstime it's going to be hugely problematicthere was one other story I did quicklywant to look at before we go to thebreak that that is this who's got theReigns on this who's holding regulationwithin companies because there werethese three figures within open AI whowere known as the doomers they were thepeople who saying look we need to testthis we need to exercise great Cocaution Samir and they're out they'reout they they were seen as the drag in away on on corporate profit and they'regone they are yeah yeah so you know it'sit's hard to know what the circumstanceswere whether this is Fallout from whathad happened before a few months ago andthey wanted to wait or you know I guesswe'll we'll find out what the becausesome of this was mixed up with the ideaof getting s Sam Alman out of thecompany I think so when when I look atthis it feels to me like this wassomething that they decided a while agobut they didn't want to do it all at thesame time for the good of the company uhyou know and I understand that some ofthem have gone to anthropic which whichis uh more you know has more ethical umuh safeguards in place and you know forthe does that quickly worry you thatthese sort of people are being pushedout forprofit in a way except I mean I'm alawyer so I sort of believe that whilethe wheels of Justice turn very slowlyeffectively they will provide the guardrails and that it's not just aboutcorporations and the people incorporations to guarantee our future soI think we're seeing regulators andcourts catching up even with things likeyou mentioned earlier about social mediayou know things are starting to catch upit takes a while I don't think it's justabout who's in the corporations it'salso about who's watching thecorporations and regulating thecorporations well I'm glad you said thatbecause next week uh we are going tospeak to commission investigate inBrussels and we're going to talk aboutrules and regulations also we're goingto focus on some of that uh in the USCongress as well Susie leer thank youfor coming on tonight the book is humanrights robots wrongs it's quite a goodread you should uh pick up a copy umafter to the break the world in yourpocket the new AI app released just 30hours ago that can translate anylanguage in real time on your phone I'llshow you how it works in fact we'll giveyou a demo and we will speak to thecreators welcome back let me paint you apicture you are the creator of a newproduct that could be sold in almost anymarket around the world but you'relimited by language you don't have aninterpreter but then no one reallyreally sells your product as well as youcan so what if you could speak to yournew clients maybe a room of clients whoall speak different languages at thesame time in real time and in theirlanguage welcome tointerpre ever found yourself in awork-related situation where noteveryone is fluent in the same language[Music]introducing interpret find now instantAI powered live translation forface-to-face Gatherings without the needfor AV Equipment you no longer need todefault to only one language interpr nowinstantly unlocks every language withyour phone and is the key to seamlessmultilingual communication whetheryou're in business meetings guided tourscoaching sessions negotiations and moreonce the initial setup is done all youhave to do is share your QR code withyour participants participants scan thecode to access interpret now eachattendee chooses the language they wantto listen read and speak in and justlike that your Gathering is officiallymultilingual God how I've needed thisfor so long with me is Sven Schumakermarketing director of interpret and alsohere for our demo tonight uh the CEO ofinterpre odman Braton thank you for bothcoming in so how does it work let'slet's go through how it works Christianthank you very much it's pleasure to behere so first of all what are we'regoing to be showcasing you tonight is anInnovative way of how people cancommunicate okay we're going to beintroducing interpre now and whatinterpre now does is it allows you toconnect in up to in over 6,000 differentlanguage combinations using AI speechtranslation and captions at the click ofthe button on your mobile phone right sowe're in a meeting correct and uh we'reall going to link together on our mobilephones what have you got on your phoneshow the show your phone to camera2 right can you see that so there's likea barcode there which I'm now going toscan with my normal photo app okay sothen it brings upinterpre type in my name correct yeah soit says Christian I don't know if youcan see that can you see that it saysChristian phraser so I'm joining joininguh this uh this group and it's says hereso that there are two functionsbasically it says on the left hand sideit says English which is what I'm goingto hear yes and it has English whichwill be the text which will appear on myphone that's your captains this is whereyou come ined all right so admond isgoing to speak Norwegian because hespeaks Norwegian and I don't andhopefully we we try all sorts on thisprogram it never goes right so here goesnothing but hopefully you're going totalk and I have a mic on the phone uhwhich people should be able to hear allright so where you go talk to us innor thank you so much for having us heretoday we are very pleased to present ournew product which is based on a thetechnology we have developed in the lastcouple of years if you are aninternational organization or haveInternationalguests then you can offer interpretationin 80 different languages it's verysimple you only need mobile phones andour simpleapplication this is I mean come on it'samazing right then then you lettechnology the magic and connect peoplebe texting in say oh yeah but you can dothis on Google you can t you can speak alanguage and it will translate intoanother language but the point is youthen have to to share your phone withsomeone else right exactly that and thatis the difference with this so everybodycan have their mobile phone you don'tneed any special kit and you can have asmany languages in the room as you wantbecause it's translated into theirlanguage so so I mean what is thepractical application of that explain tome how it's going to create profit forbusinesses smaller businessesmediumsized businesses who can't affordan interpreter well great well let'stake a practical solution uh scenariowe're in London we've got the open tourbuses M right with those buses we've gotmultiple different cultural aspects ofTourism that is entering and visitingLondon on a daily basisright with those tour buses they've gotdedicated times for specific languagesbased on what translators were availableat what time what we allowing them to dowith interpret fine now is that they canequip their guests or their touristswith the interpret Now app regardless ofwhich language they speak and they'll beable to listenhere and read so you don't need Germanbuses on one particular day you can havea mixture of different languagestherefore you can fill your bus you canup your profits correct so those 10buses don't have to necessarily havetime slots equally if you as I said atthe Top If you had a program a productyou wanted to sell you didn'tnecessarily speak the language you haddifferent say you were working for Vodaphone you go to vone in Europe all thedifferent countries there You' be ableto speak to them in realtime what aboutdialect I mean there are so manydifferent dialects how how how good isthis and does it catcheverything it it's very good I mean it'sbetter than most people at understandingaccents anddialects if they speak normal English ortheir language if you use very slangwords it might not get it but it's it'strained on a lot of data and it'sgetting better all the time on dialectsin various different we tried it inUkrainian today there are 8 differentlanguages as you say 80 times 80 is overwhat 6,000 language Comin over 6,000language combinations it can do all themwhat do you make of this me you sayyou're the Evangelist of AI is this isthis what you would take to the altar Imean I I noticed that the uh the realtime um streaming is really is reallystrong you know uh I noticed that um I Ido wonder about how you guys just it's aquestion that I face as well how do youcompete with open AFI if they I decidesto do something like this you knowtomorrow question if you're the smallerplayer do you get swamped by the bigboys it no we we actually utilize thetechnology from the big boys that that'sout there we don't yeah develop our owncore technology and actually the bigboys when they have a corporateGathering they're using us at ourtechnology for their own internalmeetings or for their customers sois we Embrace this development and we wedevelop it for the professional usersit's more of a specific use case rightit's specific but for professional usecases multilanguagemultilingual where where does thistechnology go do youthink well at the rate in AI isadvancing and some of the innovationsthat we have we've been producing Iwould say the the sky is the limit forfor the technology itself from theinterpre side of things we've definitelygot some more innovations that arecoming out that is really going toexcite the world and Advance our interprAI Solutions itself but the technologyitself it's it's it's really going toevolve into something our feel is goingto be a a human Aid there's a lot ofconversations around this is going toreplace I don't think it's replacing Ithink this is aiding taking toy now forinstance this is helping us Bridge thelanguage barrier in Communicationswith multi different people differentcultures and languages it just it juststruck me a lot of our Communicationsthese days are through um obviously uhconference sites um through um teamssomething like that do you have itincorporated into those sort of websitesthat's where we're coming from so we wehave integrated into 80 differentplatform teams zoom and and you name itso this is more a product just forOnsite to have in your pocket but wealso have the integration in the onlineplatforms so yeah definitely I I I setmy Vista very large but I I'm I'm sortof looking at this thinking the nexttime I go to Spain and I need a plumberI can talk about the technical thingsthat I can't say you know because a lotof my language is colloquial and it meanit revolves around a bar or somethinglike that but this this you could doanything with right you can talk toanybody about literally anything we'reout of time it's some fascinating thingssome some extraordinary technologycoming out which we do try and show youevery week on this program Sven hodmanSamir lovely to have your company againuh on the program we will be back nextweek with a look at the rules and theregulations what is governing who isgoverning Ai and what can we expect fromour lawmakers that's coming up next weekthank you for watching

Video script uh you are watching the context it istime for our regular weekly segment AI[Music]decoded yes welcome to AI decoded if youare a regular viewer of this programyou'll know by now that each week wedevote half an hour every Thursday tothe extraordinary advances in artificialintelligence and this week we took agiant step forward with the release ofchat GPT 40 which is significantlyeasier to operate it comes with audiovisual and text in real time an alwayshelpful always available humanlike robotto interact whenever you like do youworry about that look how obsessedpeople have become with Twitter andsocial media what if chat GPT replaceshuman interaction what if we become soobsessed with this new technology thatpeople would share their special momentswith a computer rather than you likethis man introducing his dog to his AIcompanion I want to introduce you tosomebody well hello there cutie what'syour name little sluff ball this isBowser well hello Bowser aren't you justthe most adorable little thing yeah lookat you enjoy this is one of his favoritethings todo oh I can see why look at that Focusfing balls is serious business forBowser yeah maybe no longer man's bestfriend let's take a look at how thepapers covered the release of chat GPT40 The Laughing chatting singing AI soresponsive says the guardian you couldalmost forget it's not a sentient beingyou could use it as a dating conciergethis week says the mail the founder ofdating out Bumble suggested we use ourcustomized AI to seek out the perfectpartner or maybe you don't need apartner if the AI is the super sexyrobot it's coming at you fast but who isholding the Reigns news this week fromaxio that s alman's open AI have shedthree of the doomers the more cautiousmembers of the board who'd been pushingthe safer and slower approach tonight wewill talk to the author of Human Rightsrobot wrongs lawyer Susan algra who haswritten extensively about the way AI isthreatening our rights in war sexpublishing and creativity and what wemight do to fight back there were twotriggers uh that SP spurred Susi algra'suh desire to write this book we willcome to that very shortly but with me uhin uh the studio tonight is Samir Samiris here to keep us company thank youvery much for being with us have you usechat GPT yeah I have and it's prettyimpressive I got to say um so the bigdifference is the model understands textand and uh video sound uh natively soit's almost like before there was a kindof like a translator between us and themodel and now that's gone so it's takingin more information and some of thethings that were lost uh in Translationare are now native to the model so it'sit's more expressive does he we'vetalked before aboutwhether it becomes it feels like asentient being could you have arelationship with this I think you canyeah you know and I personally you knowyou know me I'm I'm I'm an AI evangelistand I I think it's it's it's you know Ithink it's it's better that this guy isyou know on his uh showing showing thehis AI uh his his dog rather than sayyou know necessarily going on Tick Tockor something and and trying to getattention like that you know right butwhat about what about what he's teachingit where does that go I I mean is is isare the pictures that he'staking uh the things that he says tothis AI model are those being recordedEd by chat GPT yeah that's a goodquestion so they have different tiers sodepending on which tier you're on theykeep your data uh if you're on a freetier I believe they they can use it totrain their models you can opt out of itand then if you pay you they don't youknow train your models or if you're abusiness user they don't so therethere's there's options there but ofcourse it's a big question you knowwhere where is this going what are theydoing with it okay well let me introduceyou to Susie as I say there were therewere two reasons that you you you wrotethis book one was the sudden explosionof chat GPT which we're talking aboutand this narrative that everyoneovernight could be I don't know anovelist or a painter and then there wasanother story about this Belgian man whotook his own life after a six- weekintensive relationship with an AIchatbot um which which is the alarmingpart of this what what is it that mostconcerns you about where we're going Ithink what really concerns me and thisnews this week is really kind of theepto me of it is what is AI for is AI forreplacing humanity is it for replacinghuman connection and if that is whatit's for is that what we really want andthe case that you mentioned about theBelgian man who really tragically tookhis own life earlier this year afterjust 6 weeks relationship with a chatbotwhich was literally just texting orwriting into a computer it wasn't thischatting to a sexy flirty chat spot itwas literally justtexting he left behind a widow and twosmall children because he believed thathe wanted to be with his AI chatbot andthat she would provide the future tosave us from The Perils of climatechange you know it's really disturbingto think that people's minds can bemanipulated in that way so quicklythat's difficult to conceive withsomething you're having to text to andit texts back at you but if it's aconversation with someone who's voiceyou can change whose Avatar you can maketo look what like whatever you want youthen you can see why it would becomemore addictive absolutely and I wasreally quite surprised when I started tolook into it further to find how manymillions of people have signed up toservices to have ai relationships and AIcompanions which are effectively justchatbots with an avatar that you'vedesigned this ideal person and I thinkone of the big problems with it is thatif you insist on having a relationshipwith something you've created in thisperfect ideal how are you actually goingto deal with real people who areactually a bit complicated and maybedon't do what you want them to do wellI'm glad you asked that because one ofthe stories that we've focused on thisweek is this this comment from theBumble founder uh Whitney walf uh whitnewolf herd who said that the future ofdating could be filled with AI poweredpersonas setting each other up to helpwomen in their search for a connectionso the idea would be that this AI modelwould be like a concierge siftingthrough all these different profiles topick you the perfect partner and I thinkthat announcement is in one on one handa sort of sign that online dating has aproblem that there is definitely thatpeople are frustrated and not findingthe kind of human connection that theywant through online dating I mean if youcould use AI to filter out inappropriatemessages and block anyone who sends themmaybe that would be fantastic I'm notquite seeing howthis buiness to me because if you findthe perfect partner you're not on BumbleYou' already got your exactly exactlybut but but but what what we have herethough is another example of Technologybeing inserted into people's lives toreplace human connections humanrelationships andinteractions why do you think that isspecificallydangerous to socialcontrol I think it's about corporatecaptureof society of human societyand creating dependence as well I thinkmaking us you know separating us offfrom our friends and our loved onesisolating us effectively and making usemotionally psychologically andpractically dependent on what iseffectively a business model I think isreally worrying you know what happens ifyou switch off the electricity and thatwas one of the things with one of the umcompanies that run these AI chatbotrelationships replica when they werehaving problems with seeing sort ofabuse filtering through the system andthey closed down the possibility forsexting people were suddenly bereft ofthese relationships that they thoughtthey had which could just be switchedoff by a change in the business whathappens is the business goes bankruptand people are then left with nothingsort of been separated off from theirtheir social environments and I thinkthat's very worrying what I've alwayssaid with the premise of this program isthat we we we highlight the risks whichare considerable but we also show how itcan be used to great benefit so I wantto show you how chat GPT 40 has beenused to help someone who's blind have awatch is the king in Residence at themoment yes it looks like the king is inResidence right now the Royal Standardflag is flying above Buckingham Palacewhich is the signal that the Monarch ispresent how exciting to be there whilethe king is home try and tell me exactlywhat they're doing right now please umright now now the Ducks are gentlygliding across the water they're movingin a fairly relaxed manner not in ahurry occasionally one of them will dipits head under the water probablylooking for food and then pop backup I even know when a taxi is comingwith its orange light on I think I'llhail it to gethome yes I spotted one just now it'sheading you way on the left side of theroad get ready to wave itdown I mean that's pretty extraordinaryand and it shows how responsive it isbut I I listen to that voice and I justwant to turn to another chapter in yourfascinating book and it's about sexrobots and chat Bots which is which iswhere that the dangerous thing comes inyou you you when you look at this thisparticular demo that came from chat GPTthis week you can make it dramatic youcan make it serious you can make itsultry yeah and sexy um and that I thinkis where a lot of people might becomeconcerned I mean are we going to haveyoung men particularly in bedrooms whodon't interact with one another uh wholose the ability to communicate wellit's what we're seeing already as I sayeven just with the basic chat Bo this isreally just supercharging it um and Ithink when you look at use cases likethat that we've just seen you knowthat's fantastic but that doesn't meanthat you necessarily need it foreverything all the time everywhere and Ithink that's one of the problems we seewith the way AI is being rolled out iscreating dependencies and sort ofcreating social phenomena instead oflooking at discrete use cases um and Ithink the relationship question reallyis problematic and I think this is justyou know as I said looking at where weare already this I mean in in two yearstime it's going to be hugely problematicthere was one other story I did quicklywant to look at before we go to thebreak that that is this who's got theReigns on this who's holding regulationwithin companies because there werethese three figures within open AI whowere known as the doomers they were thepeople who saying look we need to testthis we need to exercise great Cocaution Samir and they're out they'reout they they were seen as the drag in away on on corporate profit and they'regone they are yeah yeah so you know it'sit's hard to know what the circumstanceswere whether this is Fallout from whathad happened before a few months ago andthey wanted to wait or you know I guesswe'll we'll find out what the becausesome of this was mixed up with the ideaof getting s Sam Alman out of thecompany I think so when when I look atthis it feels to me like this wassomething that they decided a while agobut they didn't want to do it all at thesame time for the good of the company uhyou know and I understand that some ofthem have gone to anthropic which whichis uh more you know has more ethical umuh safeguards in place and you know forthe does that quickly worry you thatthese sort of people are being pushedout forprofit in a way except I mean I'm alawyer so I sort of believe that whilethe wheels of Justice turn very slowlyeffectively they will provide the guardrails and that it's not just aboutcorporations and the people incorporations to guarantee our future soI think we're seeing regulators andcourts catching up even with things likeyou mentioned earlier about social mediayou know things are starting to catch upit takes a while I don't think it's justabout who's in the corporations it'salso about who's watching thecorporations and regulating thecorporations well I'm glad you said thatbecause next week uh we are going tospeak to commission investigate inBrussels and we're going to talk aboutrules and regulations also we're goingto focus on some of that uh in the USCongress as well Susie leer thank youfor coming on tonight the book is humanrights robots wrongs it's quite a goodread you should uh pick up a copy umafter to the break the world in yourpocket the new AI app released just 30hours ago that can translate anylanguage in real time on your phone I'llshow you how it works in fact we'll giveyou a demo and we will speak to thecreators welcome back let me paint you apicture you are the creator of a newproduct that could be sold in almost anymarket around the world but you'relimited by language you don't have aninterpreter but then no one reallyreally sells your product as well as youcan so what if you could speak to yournew clients maybe a room of clients whoall speak different languages at thesame time in real time and in theirlanguage welcome tointerpre ever found yourself in awork-related situation where noteveryone is fluent in the same language[Music]introducing interpret find now instantAI powered live translation forface-to-face Gatherings without the needfor AV Equipment you no longer need todefault to only one language interpr nowinstantly unlocks every language withyour phone and is the key to seamlessmultilingual communication whetheryou're in business meetings guided tourscoaching sessions negotiations and moreonce the initial setup is done all youhave to do is share your QR code withyour participants participants scan thecode to access interpret now eachattendee chooses the language they wantto listen read and speak in and justlike that your Gathering is officiallymultilingual God how I've needed thisfor so long with me is Sven Schumakermarketing director of interpret and alsohere for our demo tonight uh the CEO ofinterpre odman Braton thank you for bothcoming in so how does it work let'slet's go through how it works Christianthank you very much it's pleasure to behere so first of all what are we'regoing to be showcasing you tonight is anInnovative way of how people cancommunicate okay we're going to beintroducing interpre now and whatinterpre now does is it allows you toconnect in up to in over 6,000 differentlanguage combinations using AI speechtranslation and captions at the click ofthe button on your mobile phone right sowe're in a meeting correct and uh we'reall going to link together on our mobilephones what have you got on your phoneshow the show your phone to camera2 right can you see that so there's likea barcode there which I'm now going toscan with my normal photo app okay sothen it brings upinterpre type in my name correct yeah soit says Christian I don't know if youcan see that can you see that it saysChristian phraser so I'm joining joininguh this uh this group and it's says hereso that there are two functionsbasically it says on the left hand sideit says English which is what I'm goingto hear yes and it has English whichwill be the text which will appear on myphone that's your captains this is whereyou come ined all right so admond isgoing to speak Norwegian because hespeaks Norwegian and I don't andhopefully we we try all sorts on thisprogram it never goes right so here goesnothing but hopefully you're going totalk and I have a mic on the phone uhwhich people should be able to hear allright so where you go talk to us innor thank you so much for having us heretoday we are very pleased to present ournew product which is based on a thetechnology we have developed in the lastcouple of years if you are aninternational organization or haveInternationalguests then you can offer interpretationin 80 different languages it's verysimple you only need mobile phones andour simpleapplication this is I mean come on it'samazing right then then you lettechnology the magic and connect peoplebe texting in say oh yeah but you can dothis on Google you can t you can speak alanguage and it will translate intoanother language but the point is youthen have to to share your phone withsomeone else right exactly that and thatis the difference with this so everybodycan have their mobile phone you don'tneed any special kit and you can have asmany languages in the room as you wantbecause it's translated into theirlanguage so so I mean what is thepractical application of that explain tome how it's going to create profit forbusinesses smaller businessesmediumsized businesses who can't affordan interpreter well great well let'stake a practical solution uh scenariowe're in London we've got the open tourbuses M right with those buses we've gotmultiple different cultural aspects ofTourism that is entering and visitingLondon on a daily basisright with those tour buses they've gotdedicated times for specific languagesbased on what translators were availableat what time what we allowing them to dowith interpret fine now is that they canequip their guests or their touristswith the interpret Now app regardless ofwhich language they speak and they'll beable to listenhere and read so you don't need Germanbuses on one particular day you can havea mixture of different languagestherefore you can fill your bus you canup your profits correct so those 10buses don't have to necessarily havetime slots equally if you as I said atthe Top If you had a program a productyou wanted to sell you didn'tnecessarily speak the language you haddifferent say you were working for Vodaphone you go to vone in Europe all thedifferent countries there You' be ableto speak to them in realtime what aboutdialect I mean there are so manydifferent dialects how how how good isthis and does it catcheverything it it's very good I mean it'sbetter than most people at understandingaccents anddialects if they speak normal English ortheir language if you use very slangwords it might not get it but it's it'strained on a lot of data and it'sgetting better all the time on dialectsin various different we tried it inUkrainian today there are 8 differentlanguages as you say 80 times 80 is overwhat 6,000 language Comin over 6,000language combinations it can do all themwhat do you make of this me you sayyou're the Evangelist of AI is this isthis what you would take to the altar Imean I I noticed that the uh the realtime um streaming is really is reallystrong you know uh I noticed that um I Ido wonder about how you guys just it's aquestion that I face as well how do youcompete with open AFI if they I decidesto do something like this you knowtomorrow question if you're the smallerplayer do you get swamped by the bigboys it no we we actually utilize thetechnology from the big boys that that'sout there we don't yeah develop our owncore technology and actually the bigboys when they have a corporateGathering they're using us at ourtechnology for their own internalmeetings or for their customers sois we Embrace this development and we wedevelop it for the professional usersit's more of a specific use case rightit's specific but for professional usecases multilanguagemultilingual where where does thistechnology go do youthink well at the rate in AI isadvancing and some of the innovationsthat we have we've been producing Iwould say the the sky is the limit forfor the technology itself from theinterpre side of things we've definitelygot some more innovations that arecoming out that is really going toexcite the world and Advance our interprAI Solutions itself but the technologyitself it's it's it's really going toevolve into something our feel is goingto be a a human Aid there's a lot ofconversations around this is going toreplace I don't think it's replacing Ithink this is aiding taking toy now forinstance this is helping us Bridge thelanguage barrier in Communicationswith multi different people differentcultures and languages it just it juststruck me a lot of our Communicationsthese days are through um obviously uhconference sites um through um teamssomething like that do you have itincorporated into those sort of websitesthat's where we're coming from so we wehave integrated into 80 differentplatform teams zoom and and you name itso this is more a product just forOnsite to have in your pocket but wealso have the integration in the onlineplatforms so yeah definitely I I I setmy Vista very large but I I'm I'm sortof looking at this thinking the nexttime I go to Spain and I need a plumberI can talk about the technical thingsthat I can't say you know because a lotof my language is colloquial and it meanit revolves around a bar or somethinglike that but this this you could doanything with right you can talk toanybody about literally anything we'reout of time it's some fascinating thingssome some extraordinary technologycoming out which we do try and show youevery week on this program Sven hodmanSamir lovely to have your company againuh on the program we will be back nextweek with a look at the rules and theregulations what is governing who isgoverning Ai and what can we expect fromour lawmakers that's

Video script - [Narrator] Meet Walmart's Alphabot.This robot spends all day
picking items for online ordersat the company's market
fulfillment centers,and it's key to speeding
up Walmart's delivery.95% of its orders can be
picked in under 12 minutes.In the shipping war
against Amazon and Target,Walmart is leaning into the cutting edge,investing in drone deliveryand automated fulfillment centers.- By 2025, 65% of our stores
will be serviced by automation.- [Narrator] Here's how the
country's biggest retaileris going high tech to deliver
on more than just speed.This market fulfillment
center or MFC is attachedto a Walmart Supercenter
more than six times its size.Of all the company's
e-commerce fulfillment methods,MFCs have the smallest footprint.- Walmart is the largest
grocer in the country.They have added many more
different ways to get delivery,often using groceries
as sort of a linchpin,so that was a big evolution
when they started to thinkof their online business as
really a grocery business.- [Narrator] In the back of the MFC,this structure holds 6,000 to 8,000of the most popular
products sold in this area.- Our automated market fulfillment centersseparate the inventory from the goodsthat customers are shopping
on the store floor.These are appended to our back roomsor appended to our supercenters.That separate inventory
reduces congestion,and the machine-level accuracy ensuresthat we're picking the right itemsat the right times for our customers.- [Narrator] Order fulfillment starts herewhere items are scanned
into the Alphabot system.- We have about 175 bots
traversing this system.The bots move laterally,
horizontally, and verticallyto retrieve customers' goods.- [Narrator] Each robot can carrya single milk crate-size
bin that can hold anythingfrom minced garlic to 24-packs of soda.When the system receives your order,robots begin bringing your
items one bin at a timeto this picking station.At the same time, other
robots carry these empty binsfor the items to be collected in.These lights show the
associate which itemsto take and where to put it.- Instead of a user picking a productand then walking, walking,
walking to that next product,one piece of automation
could bring that productto the picker, so it does
allow opportunities to speed upthrough the picking and packing process,which inherently drives
accelerated shipping.- [Narrator] When all
the items in your orderhave been collected, the
bins get dispensed herewhere they're scanned and labeled.The crates get pushed a
few hundred feet away.Here bins from room temperature, fridge,and frozen picking are consolidatedso that a customer's entire
order is in one place.Any items that were handpicked
from the store shelvesare also brought here.Now, orders can be picked
up by customers in person,delivered by a Walmart driver,or in limited locations,
dropped off by drone,often within hours.All of these options are availablebecause the facility
is attached to a storethat's already close to the customer.Like Target, Walmart has
a huge built-in advantagewhen it comes to faster delivery,a web of more than 4,600
stores across the US alone.More than 4,000 of those
stores offer same-day deliverydirectly from those locations.Target, on the other hand,
is building a networkof facilities that would
relieve local storesof sorting and delivery duties.- Our stores provide a great advantagewhen it comes to fast delivery
because they're locatedwithin 10 miles of 90% of the population.- A few years ago, Walmart
made a massive shiftto using most of its stores
to fulfill e-commerce orders.They're trying to kind
of control more of itthan they would have in the pastand find ways to kinda use all the storesthat they already have instead
of spending more money,and it's very expensiveto build e-commerce fulfillment centers.- [Narrator] But most stores
weren't originally builtto handle both physical
and online shopping.- You may ship product from
a store that a customerin that retail store actually wantedor went specifically to purchase,and so you may be disruptingthat in-store shopping experience.- We're making substantial
investments upstreamin our distribution centers to ensurethat we can get the right itemsat the right time at our stores.We are also making significant investmentsin the digitization of our supply chain.We're utilizing AI and ML
algorithms to improve forecasting,as well as improve placement of inventoryin our stores and our fulfillment centers.- They wanna basically build
a mini version of somethingthat is specifically to
fulfill online ordersso they can do it fast.They can have a higher quantity of ordersthat move through stores.- [Narrator] Walmart now has
seven of these facilitieswith plans to open over 100
more in the next few years.But investing in MFCs
doesn't mean the companyis abandoning the traditional
e-commerce distribution modelthat relies on huge dedicated warehouses.Walmart is also investing
in five large facilitiesthat it calls next generation
fulfillment centers.Three have already opened.At 1.5 million square feet,these centers are fully automated.- Our next generation FCs,
coupled with our legacy FCs,can access 95% of the US populationwith next day or two day delivery.- They're gonna see
what we as shoppers likeand gravitate to and what they can afford,what makes it a little
bit more profitable.- Customers are willing to
change brands if they're ableto get their product much faster,and that race for speed is
really being driven by a numberof factors, including
fragmentation of retail base.You're seeing more and more
startup companies being ableto compete with traditional retailers.They're able to provide that
next-day service to customers,and that's really driving expectationsfor many other retailers
and their customers.- [Narrator] As e-commerce
becomes a biggerand bigger share of overall retail sales.- Walmart is experimenting
with lots of thingsand hoping that some of them stick.We're kind of back to 2019 in retail.A lot of weird things
that happened during COVIDthat impacted the business.Now they have to get
back to competing head onfor every dollar.- Speed is important within this space,but what's also important
is being time-definite.We don't always ship things
as fast as we can send them.Sometimes customers want
to have items deliveredat a specific time,and we aim to meet customers
the way they want to be met.- E-commerce delivery,
especially small little itemsto your doorstep in any form
is not necessarily profitable.Walmart is trying to take
a somewhat similar approachto Amazon, which uses advertising dollarsor cloud computing profitsto offset the cost of fast delivery.- [Narrator] Customers also
pay for some of that cost.Walmart+ members pay $98
annually for free shippingwith fees for delivery within hours.But one of the most important cost saverscould be Walmart's
investment in automation.- What's sort of striking is thatas Walmart rolls out
automation, it will changewhat a warehouse job or
retail job is in Americabecause Walmart's the
largest private employerin the country.Some of the workers that I
talked to that have transitionedto these new roles said
that their coworkerswho haven't made the leap
are sort of, in some cases,afraid of the technology.It's such a different job,they just don't necessarily
feel comfortable with it yet.- [Narrator] But Walmart saysit's not shrinking its workforce overall.- As we've talked to our associates,we talk about how work is
going to look different.Today they may walk anywhere
from eight to ten miles a day,lift hundreds of items or move cases,driving powered industrial equipment.In the future, our associates
are going to operate,be cell operators.They're going to be
maintenance technicians.These are the roles that will require themto use their problem solving
skills, their creativity.- [Narrator] All of that
automation is being implementedin the pursuit of undamaged
packages delivered exactlywhen customers want.- To deliver the perfect order,we're investing in digitizing
our end-to-end supply chainto ensure that we have the right itemsin the right locations at the right time.We're investing in automationso that we can have right-sized packages,so that we can have fully
curbside recyclable orders,and so that we can have the
level of precision requiredto ensure that orders are fully accuratewhen they arrive on customers' doorsteps.- Walmart still has a long way
to go in terms of catching upwith Amazon on e-commerce,but they're a bigger company than Amazon,and Amazon hasn't quite
figured out stores yet,so they're actually competingin interesting ways on multiple fronts.- [Narrator] In our final
episode, it's all about you,the customer, and your experiences.(upbeat music)

Video script So, there's this snack here in India that 
I love - hot chips. These are specifically  banana chips and you can get them in all kinds of 
varieties and flavors, different vegetables and  fruits can be turned into these chips, and 
they're delicious. But, let's imagine that  this guy in the purple shirt wants to take his 
business online, he wants to become a pan India  direct-to-consumer brand. How does he do that? 
Well, one option is that he can start a website  and begin selling his chips online but he'll 
need to make a pretty large upfront investment  to do that - he'll need to create a website or 
an online storefront which isn't impossible,  he could use an ecommerce technology company like 
Dukaan, for example, but then there's cataloging,  inventory management, dynamic pricing, order 
management, order fulfillment, and optimization  of delivery costs. And, he might get some of 
those things or even all of those things from an  e-commerce technology company but even with all of 
those things are people going to want to buy hot  chips from him online? Will people even notice his 
brand? If he has a shop on the side of the road,  that's instant customer acquisition - someone 
is driving along, they spot his store and they  buy his chips but online it's going to be really, 
really hard for him to get noticed - he'll need to  spend tons of money buying website or social media 
ads so that his products stand out and this is why  a lot of small business owners in India choose to 
stay offline. If they're on the side of the road,  they might need to compete with one or two other 
nearby stores but that's it. The competition is  minimal whereas online you're literally competing 
with every other online hot chips company and to  do that, to compete, the amount of time, money, 
and energy required just causes a lot of people  to give up before they've even started. But, there 
is one alternative, something that started here in  India in the mid to late August - marketplaces 
sellers can list their products on an e-commerce  platform like Amazon or Flipkart and everything 
is taken care of including exposure. Just by  being on one of these platforms, their products 
will automatically get recommended to consumers,  and if they're good, if their products 
get purchased frequently and customers  are satisfied. then sellers can make a lot of 
money, far more than they might have if they  were only selling direct-to-consumer on their own 
website or offline. And that's the allure of these  e-commerce platforms - they've made the barrier 
to entry so low, that sellers feel comfortable  and confident listing their products on them. 
That was one of the keys to them being able to  establish a monopoly here in India - they made it 
easy for sellers to sell stuff online, but here's  the catch: these are 1. American-owned companies 
- Amazon has been an American company from Day 1  and Flipkart is an Indian company headquartered 
in Singapore and owned by an American company,  Walmart, and 2. These are companies. Which might 
be a problem - they're not public pieces of  infrastructure, these are giant businesses with 
one primary objective - making money. And, they  do this with control. They are the middleman. They 
indirectly take money from buyers, they indirectly  take money from sellers, and we're okay with that 
not because it's something that we're happy with,  but because there just aren't a lot of great 
alternatives. It's kind of like Google - you  could go to the library and look stuff up in 
books or you could use an alternative like Bing  or DuckDuckGo, but let's be real here - 
Google is Google. And, that's the way it  is with e-commerce - Amazon is Amazon, Flipkart 
is Flipkart, and nothing can replace them. So,  if you're the Government of India, you identify 
these problems - these are American platforms with  a monopoly in India and these are companies 
that will do anything to make more money.  How do you solve these problems though? Well, 
that is where ONDC comes in, and I'm going to  be explaining how it works and more specifically, 
how it might benefit D2C startups because that's  what we talk about here at Backstage with 
Billionaires - startups, right after this.So, right off the bat, I want to be 
absolutely clear about this so that there's  no misunderstanding because I do think a lot of 
people are confused about this - ONDC is not a  replacement for Amazon or Flipkart or any other 
e-commerce offering - this is not a competing  platform. In fact, it's not a platform at all. 
Instead, ONDC is a network that sellers, apps,  websites, e-commerce platforms, basically 
any seller that is interacting with a buyer,  can join and we've already got companies 
like Paytm Mall, PhonePe, Ekart, which is  Flipkart's logistics arm, and Dunzo, figuring 
out how to integrate their offerings with ONDC,  and companies like ITC, Unilever, Dabur, 
Nivea, Shopify, Google, Meesho, and Snapdeal  have shown interest. And, the reason that they've 
shown interest and they're being so cooperative is  that ONDC isn't an app, it's not an aggregator, 
it's not a source of competition. It is a  network and I think that might be a little bit 
difficult for some of us to wrap our heads around,  so let me explain it in a different way. So, UPI 
is kind of like the digital payments version of  ONDC - it's a piece of digital infrastructure, but 
it isn't its own app, it's not replacing PhonePe  and Google Pay or Paytm, it's just there as a 
foundation for them to build on. Now, you do have  BHIM which is the NPCI's default UPI app but it's 
not trying to compete with the private players in  India's digital payment space, it's just there, 
is an option in case people want to use it. But,  ONDC isn't even going to have its own BHIM-like 
app. So then, the obvious question is how are  you going to shop with ONDC if it doesn't have an 
app or a website? Well, you won't, it'll happen  automatically. See, any existing platform 
can sign up with and join the ONDC network,  and when they do that, all of the existing 
products that are listed on their platform  end up on the ONDC network too. So, what this 
means is that if you're accessing, say, Myntra, as  a shopper, and this is a hypothetical situation, 
let's just say that Myntra has joined ONDC and  you're shopping for clothes, well you might see 
clothes that are listed on other platforms too,  like for example D2C brands like Bombay Shirt 
Company or Nicobar. And, these are two brands  that, to my knowledge, are not currently on amazon 
or Flipkart or Myntra, and if I had to guess why,  it's probably a control thing. They don't want to 
give these platforms control over their products,  they as a D2C brand want to set their own rules, 
so if and when they join on dc it's going to give  them the exposure that they would have had if 
they were listed on these e-commerce platforms,  but with none of the downsides. And this idea 
becomes even more powerful when we're talking  about diverse marketplaces that are literally 
built for D2C brands like, for example, Dukaan,  and I'll show you what I mean here. Let's 
say that instead of ordering from Myntra,  you want to buy clothes from a local store. So, 
you plug in your location, I'm here in Bengaluru,  then you choose a category, fashion garments 
and clothing, and then you hit search. See  all of these offerings? If Dukaan were 
to join ONDC when it officially launches,  then all of these sellers, because their 
stores are built on Dukaan's platform,  would be able to gain access to the benefits of 
ONDC too. And, it's through platforms like Dukaan,  that ONDC can become a powerful option not just 
for big D2C brands but also small individual  sellers who have created online storefronts 
with platforms like Dukaan. With Dukaan,  they can make a website, they can list products 
on that website, they can manage their inventory,  take orders from customers, fulfill those 
orders, and ultimately receive payments. And,  on top of all of that, they also gain access to 
services like marketing and customer management,  and Dukaan also has tie-ups with platforms 
like Privy and Mailchimp too, so for a seller,  this is the one platform that they'll need to 
get online and stay online successfully. And,  I know that many of you watching this video have 
thought and dreamed about starting a business,  selling products or services online, but maybe 
all of the stuff involved in doing that is just  too overwhelming, there's too many challenges to 
overcome, kind of like that guy selling hot chips  in the purple shirt at the beginning of the video, 
where you feel like the only option that you have  is to sell on giant e-commerce platforms 
that take a huge cut out of your revenue,  and might even steal your idea and Dukaan might be 
the solution here. So, if Dukaan sounds like the  platform for you, then click on the link in the 
description or the pinned comment down below and  start selling online today. See, right now, the 
online e-commerce shopping experience for Indians  is a lot like a giant department store - if we're 
talking about India maybe we could compare it to a  DMart, or if you're watching this video from North 
America, then it would be more like a Costco. And,  these stores are full of products from various 
brands but the stores themselves are owned by a  company and that company sets its own rules. They 
choose which items are displayed prominently at  the front of the store, which items are stashed 
near the back where most people won't see them,  they choose which items are stocked, and which 
items are rejected, and their main objective of  course is to make money. They don't fundamentally 
or primarily care about the people in the store,  they don't care about the companies who make the 
products on their shelves, and if a product starts  to perform well they can technically just copy 
it and sell their own version at a cheaper price.  They're the store, they set their own rules, and 
this makes it super hard for D2C brands to compete  on these platforms. Now, I say D2C brand here 
which might be a little bit confusing because  doesn't being on an ecommerce platform sort 
of invalidate that D2C title? Wouldn't it be  indirect-to-consumer because they're going through 
a middleman like Amazon or Flipkart, meaning that  they're not selling directly to consumers? 
Well, that's the thing - pure-play D2C is  really uncommon here in India, because e-commerce 
platforms provide brands with incredible amounts  of exposure. They are product discovery platforms 
for consumers which means that when you search for  baby skin care on Amazon, Mamaearth and The Mom's 
Co. are gonna be there at the top of the page,  and that's great for their business, that's 
exposure that they wouldn't be getting if they  didn't make their products available on Amazon 
in the first place. But, there's also a risk  associated with this because if a brand does too 
well, Amazon might take notice and if they take  notice, well they've got all of the data at their 
fingertips and they can copy whatever Mamaearth or  The Mom's Co. are doing, slap a Solimo sticker 
on it - that's one of their private labels,  which they created specifically for the Indian 
market - they can lower the price to a number  that Mamaearth and The Mom's Co. just can't 
compete with and they could in theory start  profiting off this stolen idea. Now, I just 
want to be absolutely clear here, this kind of  anti-competitive behavior is not allowed in India, 
and so far it hasn't been proven by the CCI,  the Competition Commission of India, that Amazon 
or Flipkart have committed anti-competitive  behavior, the CCI's probe into Amazon and Flipkart 
hasn't been concluded yet, they've been looking  into whether or not these companies have been 
behaving in an anti-competitive way since 2020  and the probe is still ongoing, and the same thing 
is happening now actually, in 2022, with Swiggy  and Zomato, and there may be more companies that 
they're looking into, but the bottom line here is  that this is a trend, it's something that's very 
hard for these companies to resist - they have all  this data, they're launching in-house private 
labels, and they want these brands to succeed,  and so it's not a stretch to imagine that they're 
secretly using this data that they've collected to  find this success, to the detriment of smaller 
brands. Now, coming back to that retail store  analogy, if private e-commerce platforms are 
like retail stores, then ONDC would kind of  be like a giant shopping mall, you've got tons of 
retail stores, grocery stores, restaurants small,  kiosks basically any online platform where 
a seller can sell something to a buyer is  allowed to be on ONDC, and the owners of this 
massive shopping mall, the Government of India,  set the rules. This is a way for them to gain 
more control and oversight over e-commerce in  India which frankly has been going off the rails 
a bit because like I said big e-commerce platforms  only care about one thing - making money. With 
ONDC, these big e-commerce platforms are gonna  have to compete with smaller stores, websites, and 
brands in ways that they've never had to before,  and this is gonna open up so many opportunities 
for D2C startups to shine because currently if  an e-commerce giant wants to copy the products 
of a small D2C brand, then the impact that this  has on the brand is massive. Basically, if the 
D2C brand here is getting some of or most of its  traffic from a giant e-commerce platform, then 
that revenue source shrinks significantly when  the e-commerce platform copies their product, or 
it might even dry up all together because said  e-commerce giant might be intentionally siphoning 
away traffic from the D2C product and redirecting  it towards their own cheaper private label product 
instead, and some D2C brands may even choose to  avoid e-commerce platforms altogether because of 
this risk. But, with ONDC with the playing field  level, this D2C product will, in theory, still 
get the traffic that it deserves and possibly  even more on top of that. With ONDC, consumers 
who are shopping on these e-commerce websites will  see these products recommended and they'll see 
them on other websites too, they'll see them on  basically any ONDC-compatible app or website that 
the D2C brand wants their product to be listed on,  irrespective of whether or not these websites 
want that to happen. And, the best part is that  these D2C brands will be closer to pure-play 
direct-to-consumer brands. Now, they can set up  their website and their social media and focus 
exclusively on marketing for those channels  and as long as they've signed up with ONDC and 
their products are listed on the ONDC network,  then they'll get residual traffic from said 
network without having to spend any extra money,  and of course, they'll also get benefits 
like dynamic pricing, inventory management,  and optimization of delivery costs, they'll 
be getting cataloging, order management,  and order fulfillment. But, most importantly, 
they'll be getting control and free exposure. Now,  one downside here, of course, is that when you 
open the floodgates and allow any seller to list  on any platform suddenly, you're competing with 
a much larger number of brands and companies,  but as long as your products are high quality and 
priced competitively, in theory you should be able  to withstand this competition. But, what about 
brands that aren't making high quality products,  brands that are making misleading or inferior 
products, will they get undeserved exposure  from ONDC? Back in 2015, a customer who ordered 
an iPhone from Flipkart, got mangoes instead.  In 2016, a man who ordered a Canon camera from 
Amazon, got a brick instead. These are India's  leading e-commerce platforms and they've worked 
hard to ensure that these kinds of incidents  don't happen regularly, it's bad PR for them, 
which is why they've spent huge amounts of time  and money to fix these issues as best they 
can and even though they've hit these little  bumps in the road from time to time, I, as a 
consumer, trust these e-commerce platforms over  alternatives. When I go to a D2C company's 
website to shop, I'm there for the product.  But, when I go to Amazon or Flipkart, it's not 
usually because of any one specific product,  it's because I trust these platforms. Because I 
know that if I order something and it's broken or  the delivery is delayed or something goes wrong, 
I can complain and get a refund or replacement,  and if neither one of those things work, then I 
can complain on the internet and eventually some  customer support person on Twitter will help me 
out. But with ONDC, with the playing field level,  what's to stop platforms who don't care as much 
about after sale support, about product quality,  about timely shipping, and customer centricity. 
What's to stop them from diverting sales away from  these trusted platforms to their own platforms 
where they can rip people off? With ONDC, I worry  that these platforms might get undeserved exposure 
and I do trust that there will be a filtration  process here that platforms who don't force 
their sellers to abide by the rules will either  be kicked off of ONDC or their prominence will go 
down, they won't be getting as much visibility but  people always find ways around these filters. For 
example, sellers might get bots to review or like  their products or they might even order products 
to trick the platforms that they're selling on  into thinking that their products are selling 
a lot. And so, I worry that people will be able  to abuse or manipulate ONDC to their own benefit 
and I worry that this is going to result in people  ending up buying sketchy products from platforms 
that they didn't intend to shop on. I'll give you  an example of what I'm talking about - let's say 
you're on Swiggy, and you're looking to order some  Chicken 65, and you find a great place, it's a bit 
pricey, it's a little bit far away, but it's rated  highly and it's hygienic. But then, through the 
ONDC network, you find a place where it's cheaper,  it's closer, and the pictures just make it look 
even more delicious. But, it's not on Swiggy,  it's on some random platform that you've 
never heard of, but you decide to take a risk,  and you get food poisoning and I know that 
this example seems really contrived but I'm  just trying to paint a picture of what might end 
up happening if people are being diverted away  from the platforms that they love and trust onto 
other platforms that they're not familiar with,  that might be more sketchy and unsafe. One 
other concern that I have and this is going  to sound a little bit weird but I worry about the 
impact that this is gonna have on big e-commerce  players because they don't want the playing field 
to be level, they don't want transparent pricing,  they don't want anyone and everyone 
to be able to sell on their platform,  they don't wanna give up control because that's 
going to cause them to lose money and so my  prediction here is that these e-commerce giants 
are going to figure out a way to have their cake  and eat it too - they'll happily join ONDC and 
that'll be the light version of their platform,  the free version which complies with all 
of ONDC's rules, and then they'll set up a  secondary line of business, a new premium platform 
for paying members which is separate from ONDC.  And, as we all know Amazon is already nicely 
set up for this, they have Amazon Prime,  and my guess is that this will become a separate 
website or maybe a toggle that members can click  on to switch between the premium version of the 
website and the ONDC version of the website, and  if this happens across multiple platforms, then 
ONDC may come to be associated with lower quality,  less buyer safety and security, and shoddy 
after sale support - that's my fear. Anyways,  now that's just a prediction obviously but 
I'm curious to know what are your predictions?  How are things going to change with ONDC? What 
should we expect? Is it going to be seismic or  is it going to be underwhelming? Is it going to 
be beneficial or is it going to be detrimental?  Let me know what your thoughts are in a comment 
down below and I will see you in the next one.

Video script Today I think it's a very different India, which is full of confidence.There’s a sense of our time has come.Life in Indiahas changed profoundly
over the past couple of decades.Thanks in no small part to technology
and outsourcing servicesthat made India the Office to the World.Today, this vast country of more than 1.4 billion
people is nearingthe most significant milestone
in its social and economic development.The unprecedented digitalization
that makes it possible for Indiansto access financial services, healthcare.
education and commercein ways that seemed impossible
only a few years ago.Nandan Nilekani,
co-founder of one of India'sleading technology companies, Infosys, isone of the visionaries
behind India's digitalization.His spearheaded Aadhaar, the world's
largest biometric ID system,and is leading the development
of India Stack,the public decentralized
digital infrastructurethat is the backbone
of India's transformation.As Morgan Stanley's Chief Equity
Strategist in India,I've been following this mega-trend
since its beginning.I was eager to speak with Nandan about how
the idea unfolded and where it's going.So I sat down with him at his offices
in Bangalore,where we talked about his vision,
not just for India,but for much of the developing world.Hello, Nandan.It's great to have you here.You're best known for being the co-founder
and current chairman of Infosys,a little lesser known for all the
bestselling books you've written.You're also a pioneering
philanthropist in this country.But we are here to discuss about your work
on India's digitalization.When you founded Infosys, India
was very different from what it is today.What is it that has struck you
the most about the changethat has happened
in the last three decades?It was a very different India at
that time, much beforeeconomic reforms, business was hard to do.We had to convince people
about why a bunch of first generation guyscould start a company because Infosys was
India's original startup in that sense.Today I think it's a very different India,which is full of confidence, where peoplegraduating from our colleges
like IIT want to start companies here.There is a sense of our time has come.Was there a light bulb momentwhen you realized you could use
your resources to reboot India?You know, I first contributed
to governancewhen I did something called the Bangalore
Agenda Task Force.And what I realized was thatit's a different way of doing things
from the private sector.I learned a lot and I thought technology
was not relevant to government.But after three
or four years of doing that,the only way to solve
this is through technology.So I was convinced
that technology could contribute.And that's why when I got this opportunity
to join the governmentand lead the Aadhaar project,I just took it and said, okay,
let me let me see what I can do.While you're on the subject of Aadhaar,
talk about India Stack.It's not an app. It's not a platform.What exactly is India Stack?Think about India Stack
just like the Internet or G.P.S.,which everybody uses,
but it's behind the scenes.It's digital, public infrastructure.And India Stack is a set of layeredcapabilities that India has builtover the last 15 years.
Each of which is at population scale,at very low cost,
accessible on your fingertips,on your phone,
and all interoperating with each other.So the overall thing
creates a capability for the countryto do innovation, which can
then be done in different sectors.What inspired the idea?Well, the ID was definitely something
which I thought about deeply.I wrote about it in my first book,
Imagining India,that a digital ID
would help in many ways.I talked about like benefit transfers
and all that.That's
how I actually ended up with this job.So the government had independently set up
a committeeto do something about unique IDs
back in 2006.They didn't think of it
as a digital ID, just unique ID.I think the value add that I did
and the team is, let's do itfor the future.Do it digitally.Do it on the cloudand do it with platform thinking and APIs.So it's just like GPS
answered to the question, Where am I?Aadhaar would answer the question, Who am I?Is there any other parallel in the world?Large companies have I.T. platforms,a big part of the internet story,but there's no public
digital infrastructure at this scalewhich 1.3 billion people use
and which is available with open APIsso you can construct
users and applications on top.So digitalization has broughtabout sweeping social change in India.Could you share some examples with our viewers
on how it is changing the lives of people?I think many things are happening.One is the ID itself drove inclusionbecause people now
could actually show their IDs.We built something called KYC,Know Your Customer, which you can open
a bank account or get a mobile connection.And then the government launched
the Agenda Niche programto make financial inclusion ubiquitous.And, you know, a few hundred
million people own bank accounts.And the way they were able to do
that was by using the KYC.So the electronic KYC accelerated
financial inclusion,which allowed more people
to participate in the economy.So Aadhaar EKYC
then became the instrument of accessfor citizens into the banking system
and into the mobile industry.So this combination of everybody
having an ID,more and more people having a smartphone,
with cheap dataand a low cost payment systemdrove the whole digital revolution
post 2016.And are there examples in healthcare,
education?I think there's a broad consensus
in India acrosspolitical leaders,
bureaucrats, technocrats, entrepreneursthat technology is the only way
we can leapfrog in many of these areas.So absolutely, the government's
Deep Shot program, which enabledmillions of teachers to learn,
was all rolled out in the pandemicwhen the children couldn't come to school.On health, there's this whole plan
to create a Health Stack,to create interoperable
electronic health records.Let me take the clock back to the first decade of the millennium
when Aadhaar was formally launched.You must have had a vision
about India Stack then.How well have we fared with that vision?Well I think I had a vague idea that usingdigital ID as a foundation that’s why it’s called Aadhaar, 
which means foundation.Opening it up with APIs
to build applications.Creating a KYC to accelerate
financial inclusion, mobile inclusion.I think that was very clear.One of the best use cases of India Stack
globallyknown is UPI,
which is Unified Payments Interface.Can we talk a little bit about that?The idea of UPI was brewing in our heads
in those days.The first meeting on UPI happened
only in 2013,and then we saw
the rapid rise of smartphones.And then we realized that if you can bring
a mobile first payment systemand attach it to the growth of the phone,
then you're going to create, you know,massive e-commerce capabilities.So I think that by that time
we had figured that out.We had obviously figured out the bank
connection and the governmenttransfers because that was the main reason
for doing it.But later on, we realized thatthese things can be combined in ways
that we didn't even think about.If you make these digital public
infrastructure at scale and enableit to be used by different entrepreneurs
and so on, it creates new possibilities.So now we are at that stage
where I'm seeing new innovations,which I had not thought about,
so which is a sign that it's working.Innovations
like Open Network Digital Commerce? Yes.I mean, I think there are three or four
things happeningwhich are really exciting.One of course is ONDC.
Once ONDC goes up at scalehyper local commerce
will become very easy to do.So you can sit in your house on your app
and order some you know, instantgroceries ortoothpaste or whatever you want
from the neighborhood kiranabecause he’ll have connected into ONDC
and it'll allow everyoneto participate in commerce.Then there is the democratization
of credit.India's credit to GDP ratio
 is much lower than many countries,and a lot of it goes to big guys
because for the lender,the knowledge of summitry and costs
of dealing with a smallborrower is too high,
so they don't give them the loans.Now, what we are seeing
is that once you are digital,you have digital footprints,
you know what payments you received,what invoices you ordered, and so on.All of this is what we call information
collateral.So instead of using asset collateral,use information collateral
to get access to credit.So suddenly democratize credit
at population scale.And then there's a big AI thing,
which is going to change India dramatically.Does AI poses a threat to India Stack
or is it complementary?It’s absolutely complementary.See, India Stack is infrastructure.There are many AI use cases.The amplification of human capability with AIto deliver services to a lot more people,that's one big thing which I think
will happen, which will have a big impact.If you have a shortage of teachers,
how do you get the bestteaching to every child?You can use AI to make that happen.If you have a shortage of doctors
and nurses,how do we get the best medical treatment
to every patient?The other big thing is languages.
For 22 Indian languages.they're going to create the complete open
capability to translatespeech to speech, speech
to text, text to speech, all that.And suddenly,
every Indian will be able to talk or writeor read in their language to somebody else
who's in another language.Are you seeing any other countryattempt something like this? Given
India's roaring success,are there are other countries
that think that they need their own Stack?I think there is definitely a muchbetter understanding in the world
of digital public infrastructure,and definitely people
are realizing the value of this.But the challenge is how do you do it
strategicallyover five, ten years, and
how do you build these building blocks?And then how do you make these building
blocks interoperate?That's the hard part.You know, I like this book that
you’ve recently written, The Art of Bitfulness.So what would you recommend to our viewers
to stay calm in this very hyperdigital world?My thesis is we should use technology,
but in the way that you controlthe technology in the tech world
doesn't control you.So The Art of Bitfulnessis really about how to stay calm
and what are some of the practicesyou can have.So it's just a way of saying technology
is great, but use it in proper doses.What's the next big thing for Nandan Nilekani?Well, actually, I don't think like that.You know,
I just think about doing new things.I'm deeply
looking at how AI will change the industry.It's a structural paradigm shift.So that’s at the Infosys level.I really want to make sure that
this AI journey happens well.But otherwise, how do I take digitalpublic infrastructure global?How do we get more and more countries to
adopt this as fundamental to their future?That's what I like to focus on.That's wonderful.Thank you so much for your time.It was a pleasure speaking to you.

Video script So, there's this snack here in India that 
I love - hot chips. These are specifically  banana chips and you can get them in all kinds of 
varieties and flavors, different vegetables and  fruits can be turned into these chips, and 
they're delicious. But, let's imagine that  this guy in the purple shirt wants to take his 
business online, he wants to become a pan India  direct-to-consumer brand. How does he do that? 
Well, one option is that he can start a website  and begin selling his chips online but he'll 
need to make a pretty large upfront investment  to do that - he'll need to create a website or 
an online storefront which isn't impossible,  he could use an ecommerce technology company like 
Dukaan, for example, but then there's cataloging,  inventory management, dynamic pricing, order 
management, order fulfillment, and optimization  of delivery costs. And, he might get some of 
those things or even all of those things from an  e-commerce technology company but even with all of 
those things are people going to want to buy hot  chips from him online? Will people even notice his 
brand? If he has a shop on the side of the road,  that's instant customer acquisition - someone 
is driving along, they spot his store and they  buy his chips but online it's going to be really, 
really hard for him to get noticed - he'll need to  spend tons of money buying website or social media 
ads so that his products stand out and this is why  a lot of small business owners in India choose to 
stay offline. If they're on the side of the road,  they might need to compete with one or two other 
nearby stores but that's it. The competition is  minimal whereas online you're literally competing 
with every other online hot chips company and to  do that, to compete, the amount of time, money, 
and energy required just causes a lot of people  to give up before they've even started. But, there 
is one alternative, something that started here in  India in the mid to late August - marketplaces 
sellers can list their products on an e-commerce  platform like Amazon or Flipkart and everything 
is taken care of including exposure. Just by  being on one of these platforms, their products 
will automatically get recommended to consumers,  and if they're good, if their products 
get purchased frequently and customers  are satisfied. then sellers can make a lot of 
money, far more than they might have if they  were only selling direct-to-consumer on their own 
website or offline. And that's the allure of these  e-commerce platforms - they've made the barrier 
to entry so low, that sellers feel comfortable  and confident listing their products on them. 
That was one of the keys to them being able to  establish a monopoly here in India - they made it 
easy for sellers to sell stuff online, but here's  the catch: these are 1. American-owned companies 
- Amazon has been an American company from Day 1  and Flipkart is an Indian company headquartered 
in Singapore and owned by an American company,  Walmart, and 2. These are companies. Which might 
be a problem - they're not public pieces of  infrastructure, these are giant businesses with 
one primary objective - making money. And, they  do this with control. They are the middleman. They 
indirectly take money from buyers, they indirectly  take money from sellers, and we're okay with that 
not because it's something that we're happy with,  but because there just aren't a lot of great 
alternatives. It's kind of like Google - you  could go to the library and look stuff up in 
books or you could use an alternative like Bing  or DuckDuckGo, but let's be real here - 
Google is Google. And, that's the way it  is with e-commerce - Amazon is Amazon, Flipkart 
is Flipkart, and nothing can replace them. So,  if you're the Government of India, you identify 
these problems - these are American platforms with  a monopoly in India and these are companies 
that will do anything to make more money.  How do you solve these problems though? Well, 
that is where ONDC comes in, and I'm going to  be explaining how it works and more specifically, 
how it might benefit D2C startups because that's  what we talk about here at Backstage with 
Billionaires - startups, right after this.So, right off the bat, I want to be 
absolutely clear about this so that there's  no misunderstanding because I do think a lot of 
people are confused about this - ONDC is not a  replacement for Amazon or Flipkart or any other 
e-commerce offering - this is not a competing  platform. In fact, it's not a platform at all. 
Instead, ONDC is a network that sellers, apps,  websites, e-commerce platforms, basically 
any seller that is interacting with a buyer,  can join and we've already got companies 
like Paytm Mall, PhonePe, Ekart, which is  Flipkart's logistics arm, and Dunzo, figuring 
out how to integrate their offerings with ONDC,  and companies like ITC, Unilever, Dabur, 
Nivea, Shopify, Google, Meesho, and Snapdeal  have shown interest. And, the reason that they've 
shown interest and they're being so cooperative is  that ONDC isn't an app, it's not an aggregator, 
it's not a source of competition. It is a  network and I think that might be a little bit 
difficult for some of us to wrap our heads around,  so let me explain it in a different way. So, UPI 
is kind of like the digital payments version of  ONDC - it's a piece of digital infrastructure, but 
it isn't its own app, it's not replacing PhonePe  and Google Pay or Paytm, it's just there as a 
foundation for them to build on. Now, you do have  BHIM which is the NPCI's default UPI app but it's 
not trying to compete with the private players in  India's digital payment space, it's just there, 
is an option in case people want to use it. But,  ONDC isn't even going to have its own BHIM-like 
app. So then, the obvious question is how are  you going to shop with ONDC if it doesn't have an 
app or a website? Well, you won't, it'll happen  automatically. See, any existing platform 
can sign up with and join the ONDC network,  and when they do that, all of the existing 
products that are listed on their platform  end up on the ONDC network too. So, what this 
means is that if you're accessing, say, Myntra, as  a shopper, and this is a hypothetical situation, 
let's just say that Myntra has joined ONDC and  you're shopping for clothes, well you might see 
clothes that are listed on other platforms too,  like for example D2C brands like Bombay Shirt 
Company or Nicobar. And, these are two brands  that, to my knowledge, are not currently on amazon 
or Flipkart or Myntra, and if I had to guess why,  it's probably a control thing. They don't want to 
give these platforms control over their products,  they as a D2C brand want to set their own rules, 
so if and when they join on dc it's going to give  them the exposure that they would have had if 
they were listed on these e-commerce platforms,  but with none of the downsides. And this idea 
becomes even more powerful when we're talking  about diverse marketplaces that are literally 
built for D2C brands like, for example, Dukaan,  and I'll show you what I mean here. Let's 
say that instead of ordering from Myntra,  you want to buy clothes from a local store. So, 
you plug in your location, I'm here in Bengaluru,  then you choose a category, fashion garments 
and clothing, and then you hit search. See  all of these offerings? If Dukaan were 
to join ONDC when it officially launches,  then all of these sellers, because their 
stores are built on Dukaan's platform,  would be able to gain access to the benefits of 
ONDC too. And, it's through platforms like Dukaan,  that ONDC can become a powerful option not just 
for big D2C brands but also small individual  sellers who have created online storefronts 
with platforms like Dukaan. With Dukaan,  they can make a website, they can list products 
on that website, they can manage their inventory,  take orders from customers, fulfill those 
orders, and ultimately receive payments. And,  on top of all of that, they also gain access to 
services like marketing and customer management,  and Dukaan also has tie-ups with platforms 
like Privy and Mailchimp too, so for a seller,  this is the one platform that they'll need to 
get online and stay online successfully. And,  I know that many of you watching this video have 
thought and dreamed about starting a business,  selling products or services online, but maybe 
all of the stuff involved in doing that is just  too overwhelming, there's too many challenges to 
overcome, kind of like that guy selling hot chips  in the purple shirt at the beginning of the video, 
where you feel like the only option that you have  is to sell on giant e-commerce platforms 
that take a huge cut out of your revenue,  and might even steal your idea and Dukaan might be 
the solution here. So, if Dukaan sounds like the  platform for you, then click on the link in the 
description or the pinned comment down below and  start selling online today. See, right now, the 
online e-commerce shopping experience for Indians  is a lot like a giant department store - if we're 
talking about India maybe we could compare it to a  DMart, or if you're watching this video from North 
America, then it would be more like a Costco. And,  these stores are full of products from various 
brands but the stores themselves are owned by a  company and that company sets its own rules. They 
choose which items are displayed prominently at  the front of the store, which items are stashed 
near the back where most people won't see them,  they choose which items are stocked, and which 
items are rejected, and their main objective of  course is to make money. They don't fundamentally 
or primarily care about the people in the store,  they don't care about the companies who make the 
products on their shelves, and if a product starts  to perform well they can technically just copy 
it and sell their own version at a cheaper price.  They're the store, they set their own rules, and 
this makes it super hard for D2C brands to compete  on these platforms. Now, I say D2C brand here 
which might be a little bit confusing because  doesn't being on an ecommerce platform sort 
of invalidate that D2C title? Wouldn't it be  indirect-to-consumer because they're going through 
a middleman like Amazon or Flipkart, meaning that  they're not selling directly to consumers? 
Well, that's the thing - pure-play D2C is  really uncommon here in India, because e-commerce 
platforms provide brands with incredible amounts  of exposure. They are product discovery platforms 
for consumers which means that when you search for  baby skin care on Amazon, Mamaearth and The Mom's 
Co. are gonna be there at the top of the page,  and that's great for their business, that's 
exposure that they wouldn't be getting if they  didn't make their products available on Amazon 
in the first place. But, there's also a risk  associated with this because if a brand does too 
well, Amazon might take notice and if they take  notice, well they've got all of the data at their 
fingertips and they can copy whatever Mamaearth or  The Mom's Co. are doing, slap a Solimo sticker 
on it - that's one of their private labels,  which they created specifically for the Indian 
market - they can lower the price to a number  that Mamaearth and The Mom's Co. just can't 
compete with and they could in theory start  profiting off this stolen idea. Now, I just 
want to be absolutely clear here, this kind of  anti-competitive behavior is not allowed in India, 
and so far it hasn't been proven by the CCI,  the Competition Commission of India, that Amazon 
or Flipkart have committed anti-competitive  behavior, the CCI's probe into Amazon and Flipkart 
hasn't been concluded yet, they've been looking  into whether or not these companies have been 
behaving in an anti-competitive way since 2020  and the probe is still ongoing, and the same thing 
is happening now actually, in 2022, with Swiggy  and Zomato, and there may be more companies that 
they're looking into, but the bottom line here is  that this is a trend, it's something that's very 
hard for these companies to resist - they have all  this data, they're launching in-house private 
labels, and they want these brands to succeed,  and so it's not a stretch to imagine that they're 
secretly using this data that they've collected to  find this success, to the detriment of smaller 
brands. Now, coming back to that retail store  analogy, if private e-commerce platforms are 
like retail stores, then ONDC would kind of  be like a giant shopping mall, you've got tons of 
retail stores, grocery stores, restaurants small,  kiosks basically any online platform where 
a seller can sell something to a buyer is  allowed to be on ONDC, and the owners of this 
massive shopping mall, the Government of India,  set the rules. This is a way for them to gain 
more control and oversight over e-commerce in  India which frankly has been going off the rails 
a bit because like I said big e-commerce platforms  only care about one thing - making money. With 
ONDC, these big e-commerce platforms are gonna  have to compete with smaller stores, websites, and 
brands in ways that they've never had to before,  and this is gonna open up so many opportunities 
for D2C startups to shine because currently if  an e-commerce giant wants to copy the products 
of a small D2C brand, then the impact that this  has on the brand is massive. Basically, if the 
D2C brand here is getting some of or most of its  traffic from a giant e-commerce platform, then 
that revenue source shrinks significantly when  the e-commerce platform copies their product, or 
it might even dry up all together because said  e-commerce giant might be intentionally siphoning 
away traffic from the D2C product and redirecting  it towards their own cheaper private label product 
instead, and some D2C brands may even choose to  avoid e-commerce platforms altogether because of 
this risk. But, with ONDC with the playing field  level, this D2C product will, in theory, still 
get the traffic that it deserves and possibly  even more on top of that. With ONDC, consumers 
who are shopping on these e-commerce websites will  see these products recommended and they'll see 
them on other websites too, they'll see them on  basically any ONDC-compatible app or website that 
the D2C brand wants their product to be listed on,  irrespective of whether or not these websites 
want that to happen. And, the best part is that  these D2C brands will be closer to pure-play 
direct-to-consumer brands. Now, they can set up  their website and their social media and focus 
exclusively on marketing for those channels  and as long as they've signed up with ONDC and 
their products are listed on the ONDC network,  then they'll get residual traffic from said 
network without having to spend any extra money,  and of course, they'll also get benefits 
like dynamic pricing, inventory management,  and optimization of delivery costs, they'll 
be getting cataloging, order management,  and order fulfillment. But, most importantly, 
they'll be getting control and free exposure. Now,  one downside here, of course, is that when you 
open the floodgates and allow any seller to list  on any platform suddenly, you're competing with 
a much larger number of brands and companies,  but as long as your products are high quality and 
priced competitively, in theory you should be able  to withstand this competition. But, what about 
brands that aren't making high quality products,  brands that are making misleading or inferior 
products, will they get undeserved exposure  from ONDC? Back in 2015, a customer who ordered 
an iPhone from Flipkart, got mangoes instead.  In 2016, a man who ordered a Canon camera from 
Amazon, got a brick instead. These are India's  leading e-commerce platforms and they've worked 
hard to ensure that these kinds of incidents  don't happen regularly, it's bad PR for them, 
which is why they've spent huge amounts of time  and money to fix these issues as best they 
can and even though they've hit these little  bumps in the road from time to time, I, as a 
consumer, trust these e-commerce platforms over  alternatives. When I go to a D2C company's 
website to shop, I'm there for the product.  But, when I go to Amazon or Flipkart, it's not 
usually because of any one specific product,  it's because I trust these platforms. Because I 
know that if I order something and it's broken or  the delivery is delayed or something goes wrong, 
I can complain and get a refund or replacement,  and if neither one of those things work, then I 
can complain on the internet and eventually some  customer support person on Twitter will help me 
out. But with ONDC, with the playing field level,  what's to stop platforms who don't care as much 
about after sale support, about product quality,  about timely shipping, and customer centricity. 
What's to stop them from diverting sales away from  these trusted platforms to their own platforms 
where they can rip people off? With ONDC, I worry  that these platforms might get undeserved exposure 
and I do trust that there will be a filtration  process here that platforms who don't force 
their sellers to abide by the rules will either  be kicked off of ONDC or their prominence will go 
down, they won't be getting as much visibility but  people always find ways around these filters. For 
example, sellers might get bots to review or like  their products or they might even order products 
to trick the platforms that they're selling on  into thinking that their products are selling 
a lot. And so, I worry that people will be able  to abuse or manipulate ONDC to their own benefit 
and I worry that this is going to result in people  ending up buying sketchy products from platforms 
that they didn't intend to shop on. I'll give you  an example of what I'm talking about - let's say 
you're on Swiggy, and you're looking to order some  Chicken 65, and you find a great place, it's a bit 
pricey, it's a little bit far away, but it's rated  highly and it's hygienic. But then, through the 
ONDC network, you find a place where it's cheaper,  it's closer, and the pictures just make it look 
even more delicious. But, it's not on Swiggy,  it's on some random platform that you've 
never heard of, but you decide to take a risk,  and you get food poisoning and I know that 
this example seems really contrived but I'm  just trying to paint a picture of what might end 
up happening if people are being diverted away  from the platforms that they love and trust onto 
other platforms that they're not familiar with,  that might be more sketchy and unsafe. One 
other concern that I have and this is going  to sound a little bit weird but I worry about the 
impact that this is gonna have on big e-commerce  players because they don't want the playing field 
to be level, they don't want transparent pricing,  they don't want anyone and everyone 
to be able to sell on their platform,  they don't wanna give up control because that's 
going to cause them to lose money and so my  prediction here is that these e-commerce giants 
are going to figure out a way to have their cake  and eat it too - they'll happily join ONDC and 
that'll be the light version of their platform,  the free version which complies with all 
of ONDC's rules, and then they'll set up a  secondary line of business, a new premium platform 
for paying members which is separate from ONDC.  And, as we all know Amazon is already nicely 
set up for this, they have Amazon Prime,  and my guess is that this will become a separate 
website or maybe a toggle that members can click  on to switch between the premium version of the 
website and the ONDC version of the website, and  if this happens across multiple platforms, then 
ONDC may come to be associated with lower quality,  less buyer safety and security, and shoddy 
after sale support - that's my fear. Anyways,  now that's just a prediction obviously but 
I'm curious to know what are your predictions?  How are things going to change with ONDC? What 
should we expect? Is it going to be seismic or  is it going to be underwhelming? Is it going to 
be beneficial or is it going to be detrimental?  Let me know what your thoughts are in a comment 
down below and I will see you in the next one.

Video script focalization in English literature is the way that 
a story is told from a certain perspective it is  the point of view from which the reader sees the 
events of the story unfold there are three main  types of focalization internal focalization the 
reader sees the events of the story Through The  Eyes of one or more characters this means that 
the reader only knows what the characters know  and see external focalization the reader sees the 
events of the story from the outside without being  able to access the thoughts or feelings of the 
characters zero focalization the narrator has  complete knowledge of the story world including 
the thoughts and feelings of all the characters  here are some examples of focalization in English 
literature internal focalization in Jane air the  reader sees the events of the story Through 
The Eyes of the protagonist Jane the reader  only knows what Jane knows and sees which helps to 
create a sense of intimacy and suspense external  focalization in The Great Gatsby the reader 
sees the events of the story from the outside  without being able to access the thoughts 
or feelings of the characters this creates  a sense of mystery and ambiguity as the reader 
is left to wonder about the motivations of the  characters zero focalization in omniscient 
narrator stories such as those by Charles  Dickens the narrator has complete knowledge 
of the story world including the thoughts and  feelings of all the characters this allows the 
narrator to provide the reader with a complete  and objective view of the story focalization is 
an important tool that writers use to control the  reader's experience of a story by choosing 
the right type of focalization writers can  create a sense of intimacy suspense mystery or 
objectivity focalization is the storyteller's  way of showing us the story it is the perspective 
from which we see the events of the story unfold  imagine that you are watching a movie the 
camera is the Storyteller tell's tool for  showing us the story the camera can be placed 
anywhere in the movie theater and it can move  around to show us different things focalization 
is like the camera in a movie it tells us where  to look and what to pay attention to in a story 
with internal focalization the camera is placed  inside the head of one or more characters we 
only see what the characters see and know in  a story with external focalization the camera 
is placed outside of the character's head heads  we see the characters from the outside and we 
only know what they say and do in a story with  zero focalization the camera can move anywhere 
in the movie theater we see the story from all  sides and we have access to the thoughts and 
feelings of all the characters focalization is  an important tool that writers use to control 
our experience of the story by choosing the  right type of focalization writers can create a 
sense of intimacy suspense mystery or objectivity

Video script hello and welcome to this introduction 
to narratology what is narratology  narratology is the theory of narrative you 
can also call it the theory of storytelling  the aim of this video is to present a pictorial 
guide mainly for beginners it is based on as  many simple graphics and animations as I was 
able to access or create this is page 1 of 12.  there are many types of stories and many 
types of narratologies and therefore we  must be selective this overview is an attempt 
to combine mainly four approaches first there's  classical narratology which is Gerard Genette's 
approach dating back to as early as 1972.  then there is Natural Narratolgy a model that 
was introduced by Monika Fludernik in 1996.  third we have focalization theory also known 
as point of view theory as developed by various  authors including myself then there is transmedial 
narratology which is a recent approach focusing  on storytelling in and across different 
media specifically including comics films  computer games and so on you may want to check 
this video's description for the full script  including references footnotes and additional 
suggestions page 2 elements of narrative texts  this page starts off with a list 
of nine basic technical terms  our first graphic is a speech bubble which depicts 
a narrative discourse a discourse is either spoken  or a written text and the speaker or writer 
of it is a narrator when telling a story the  narrator creates a story world which is populated 
by characters wait a minute is there a dog among  the characters yes there is we actually accept all 
beings human or not as possible story characters  each moment in the story's action takes place at 
a certain time and location the story Here and Now  similarly each moment in the narrator's 
discourse is situated in place and time  so this is the discourse here and now sometimes 
especially when dealing with narrative fiction we  need to add the real life author as a separate 
agent mainly because authors of fiction often  choose to invent narrators for instance an 
older author may invent a younger narrator  or a male author may let the story be told by a 
female narrator as is suggested in the picture a  narrative discourse is heard or read by an 
audience of one or more recipients please  note that narrators and recipients are 
outside or external to the story world  while characters are in or internal to the 
story world this is an important distinction  finally efficient storytelling usually depends on 
a certain amount of cooperation between narrators  and recipients narrators will consider what's 
new or familiar to their audience and adjust  their discourse accordingly likewise recipients 
will try to be open-minded and constructive in  their processing all the information provided 
and if assumptions and expectations are largely  compatible on both sides we can speak of an 
implicit narrative contract between the two  parties but as we all know contracts do 
get broken occasionally that's all there  is on this page so far the definitions are all 
fairly obvious as thankfully most definitions  in natural narratology are at least on the level 
of basics when we come to the final detail of all  this things will become a bit more challenging 
page three homodiegetic and heterodiegetic texts  there are many types of narratives but at this 
point let us focus on the two most important ones  namely first-person or homodiegetic narratives 
and third-person or heterodiegetic narratives  the Greek-based terms roughly translatable 
as same-narrative and other-narrative were  coined by Genette and they have been adopted 
by practically all modern narratologists  let's add a graphic depicting a narrator called A 
and two characters one of them called A prime and  the other one called B Why A prime because we 
want to indicate that narrator A tells a story  about himself often this is also called a memoir 
or an autobiographical narrative or a personal  experience narrative abbreviated p-e-n or pen 
many narratologists identify the homodiegetic  narrator as a narrating-I or narrating first 
person and A prime as an experiencing-I the  two terms are listed here the second main type of 
narrative is the heterodiegetic narrative here the  narrator tells a story about other people that 
is characters BCD etc what is important is that  nowhere in a heterodiegetic story world is there 
an experiencing-I like the A prime that we have on  the left in other words both types are based on a 
necessary condition a homodiegetic narrative must  have an experiencing-I and a heterodetic 
narrative must not have an experiencing-I  here is a box giving an example of how a 
homodiegetic narrator might begin his or her story  let me tell you the story of how I almost 
got killed by my brother in contrast the  heterodiegetic narrator might kick off by saying 
let me tell you a story in the hole in the ground  there lived a Hobbit which of course is the famous 
beginning of the novel by JRR Tolkien let's clear  the board and see how our model can be extended 
by adding aspects of perspective and point of view  page 4 is on perception and perspective this 
wonderful cartoon was accessed from a Creative Commons source on the internet it is a static 
picture but it is also one that tells a little  story two guys meet point at an object lying on 
the ground and apparently quarrel about what they  see and who sees it correctly guy a claims that 
the object is a 6 guy B says it is a 9 we can  immediately understand why this is so because 
we can easily adopt either A's or B's point of  view and see the object just like they do even 
of the two interpretations are contradictory  now I'd like to ask you this question does the 
picture offer any other perspectives the answer  is yes because we as viewers and also the artist 
who created the picture see or saw the object in  question from a different point of view and unlike 
characters A and B we would accept that the object  could be either a six or a nine so the number of 
perspectives depicted in the cartoon is at least  three let us use this Post-It note to introduce 
some more concepts characters shown in the act  of perceiving the story world will be called 
reflectors this is a term invented by Henry James  in 1909 A and B in the cartoon are reflectors 
reflectors are characters who are presented in  such a way that we can access or adopt their 
point of view or as the German linguist Karl Buehler  put it in 1934 transpose to their point 
of view which actually is what we just did  let us also introduced Daniel Bickerton's 
distinction between online perception and offline  perception online perception is what we perceive 
via our ordinary waking senses offline perception  is what we see in our Mind's Eye such as memories 
dreams visions and other things purely imagined  What our cartoon also shows is that a 
person's face bodily stance and behavior  can be expressive of a mental state this is 
often referred to as attributing a Theory of  Mind or guessing the operation of somebody 
else's mind for instance in the cartoon the  facial expressions of the reflectors suggest 
that both of them are wholly convinced of the  correctness of their interpretation neither of 
them seems to be willing to adopt the other's  point of view even though they should be able to 
do that just like we did with the illustration  in mind we see that perceptional perspective is 
not only determined by physical factors such as  time and place but also by psychological factors 
such as interest knowledge beliefs and attitudes  we will use the common term mindset to refer 
to mental makeups and dispositions of this kind  now page 5 is on mindset mindset effects can be 
proverbial some people can't see the wood for  the trees others can the optimist sees the glass 
as half full the pessimist sees it as half empty  let's try another example a slightly trickier one 
again our two guys see an object I'm going to show  you what they see it as in a minute before I do 
please make a mental note of what you are seeing  that object now what is it in cognitive psychology 
the case is known as the rat-man experiment  guy A sees a rat-like animal B sees an old 
man's head look at the unambiguous versions  in the two thought bubbles to verify that both 
interpretations are indeed possible though perhaps  not equally likely this raises three questions 
first what did you see a rat or the head of a man  second why does one interpretation seem to inhibit 
the other and third why is it so difficult to see  both interpretations at the same time the tricky 
point is that the decision for or against either  interpretation seems to be made automatically it 
happens beyond conscious awareness personally I  would be happy to extend the concept of mindset 
to include unconscious motives and preferences  maybe for some reason A is more interested in 
rats and B is more interested in Old Men but  who knows maybe a neuroscientist would be 
able to give us a less speculative answer  page six focalization in texts in narratology the 
term focalization refers to the perspectivization  of a story world as such it is directly related 
to perceivers, points of view and our ability to  transpose to another person's point of view there 
is some controversy about the exact definition  of focalization and also about its overall 
narratological importance my view as you can  probably guess is that it is hugely important in 
fact I think everything else depends on it here is  a simplified version of the standard storytelling 
scenario reduced to the figures of the narrator  the recipients and just one character to this 
I now add this colored green bubble indicating  the character's field of perception note the 
difference between the narrator's discourse  bubble and the character's perception bubble 
please also call to mind that perception can be  said to be colored by the perceivers mindset once 
the character is used as a reflector the narrative  turns into a reflector-mode narrative that is a 
story told from the point of view of a reflector  when a narrator opts for the reflector mode we 
are invited to transpose to the reflector's point  of view moreover it is sensible to assume that in 
order to tell a reflector-mode story the narrator  must also transpose to the reflector's point 
of view for this reason the graphic contains  two transposition arrows all told them there 
are three kinds of point of view that must be  considered when analyzing textual narratives the 
reflector's point of view the narrator's point of  view and the recipients' points of view we will 
call these internal and external focalizations  respectively why internal and external because 
as defined earlier reflectors are internal to  the story world and narrators and recipients 
are external to the storyworld note that being  external to the story world does not mean that 
narrators and recipients are necessarily neutral  or objective their perceptions are subject 
to time place and mindset conditions too  page seven the composition of film earlier 
we spent some time listing the elements of  textual narratives now let's do the 
same thing for the components of film  as we all know a film is projected onto a screen 
and it is watched by an audience of spectators  or let's call them recipients as before we also 
know that a film is produced by a team of creators  including a director a script writer actors 
composers cinematographers editors and so on  the director obviously has a special status 
and some directors more so than others   for example in this screenshot the whole film is 
credited to Alfred Hitchcock and here it is  Stanley Kubrick who gets credited for no less 
than three creative roles from a narratological  perspective film is a special type of narrative 
communication its substance is not a text or a  discourse but a composition of audiovisual 
elements as suggested in this tree diagram  which lists still and moving pictures as 
well as various types of sound and music  let us call the focal point where all of this is 
orchestrated a composition device CD for short  the CD is just a theoretical construct but it 
acts like a communicating instance without us  having to associate it with any real-life people 
such as a director also because film is a form  of meaningful communication the CD is likely 
to abide by the rules of a narrative contract  film analysis usually begins by decomposing the 
film's various sources of information in order to  assess their contribution to the composition as 
a whole often a central part of this exercise is  to assess the relevance the function the effect 
and the reliability of the data a brief analysis  of a film scene will be offered on page 12. 
and on page 8 we turn to focalization in film  the natural question is whether it is anything 
like focalization in texts for instance is what  was called a reflector mode possible in film and 
is it also possible for the recipients and the CD  to transpose to reflector's point of view well 
we already assumed as much when discussing our  original cartoon on page 4 and in film there 
is in fact a very remarkable special technique  called the point-of-view shot that represents 
the reflector mode almost perfectly perhaps  even better than is possible in texts of course 
as before the recipients have their own point of  view and so does the CD in all then just like 
in textural narratives the basic configuration  comprises one type of internal focalization and 
two types of external focalization additionally  we must call to mind that the film can also 
make use of an on-screen or off-screen narrator  in which case yet another external point of 
view needs to be added to the overall scenario  Page 9 a master template of focalization 
focalization as you may have gathered is  quite a complex field the term was coined by 
Genette and he used it to draw attention to an  important distinction namely the distinction 
between who speaks and who sees the speaker  of a narrative text according to the Genette is a 
narrator and the viewer in the text is a reflector  reconsidering this 10 years later Genette 
rephrased the reflector question as who perceives  a logical widening of the scope obviously but also 
one that lends itself to further modifications  adding an object and an adverbial extension 
we can ask who perceives what how and from  which point of view and we will use 
this version as our Master template  and here's what it looks like with options 
added in the subject or who slots we can  distinguish between external and internal 
subjects of perception and as noted external  subjects are either creative subjects like the 
narrator the author and the composition device  or recipients like readers hearers or viewers in 
the verb slot we place the online offline modes  and in the point of view slot we register the 
time place and mindset conditions and most of the  parameters listed are plain everyday concepts in 
sum then focalization refer to the ways and means  of presenting narrated worlds from the points 
of view of perceiving subjects specifically in  this definition presenting refers to any textual 
filmic or pictorial representation and a narrated  world can be a fictional or a non-fictional story 
world page 10 is on externality and internality  so far our focus was on subjects of perception 
and it was their status as external or  internal perceivers that was criterial for 
determining types of focalization however  degrees of externality and internality can also 
be found on the surface level of a presentation  we'll show you five pictures and put letters R 
and O to mark reflectors and objects of perception  as for picture 1 let's treat it as an establishing 
shot of a cityscape at the beginning of a film  no character is visible and thus no reflector is 
present either let us label this as external zero  the zero indicating that zero characters are 
present moving on to picture two we see an  elderly lady sitting in a waiting room could this 
character be a reflector well it is a possibility  but without any further information we really 
have no idea what the lady is seeing feeling or  thinking I'll Place question marked R's and O's 
but generally accept that the presentation is  basically external we can use the label external-1 
to acknowledge the presence of a character  if we know that the character is a reflector a 
label like external-R would seem appropriate and  I have added it in brackets picture 3 shows us 
Hamlet in act 5 of Shakespeare's play and now  we evidently have a reflector looking at the skull 
of Yorick the former court jester Hamlet reflects  on the meaninglessness of life as viewers we see 
the object that he sees and knowing his state of  mind we can co-experience what it is like to be in 
the desperate situation that he finds himself in  in cinematography this type of shot is called 
a reverse point of view shot and this is also  a convenient label for this type of surface 
focalization picture 4 is a famous painting  by Caspar David Friedrich entitled Wanderer above 
the Sea of Fog if this were a scene in a film the  character would be a reflector shown from behind 
the recipients see what the reflector sees from  an almost identical point of view and naturally we 
are also aware of the reflector's romantic mindset  let us call it a proximate point of view 
presentation it is a powerful type of  internal focalization but we do notice that 
it denies us a view of the reflector's face  finally item 5 is a still from an episode of the 
television series Mash aptly entitled point of  view in this point of view shot the reflector 
is a wounded soldier who is visited by the camp  Commander we do not see the reflector because the 
camera is virtually located inside his head but we  know he is there and we see what he sees we will 
call this a direct point of view presentation and  we note that neither the reflector's face no much 
of his body is visible when using this technique  of course there are many intermediate and 
borderline cases that can be added to this  particular selection nevertheless even given 
the examples at hand we can already observe  a kind of scalar progression a steady increase 
in degrees of internality moving from left to  right and a steady increase in externality moving 
from right to left page 11 a scene from Vertigo  analyzing pictures in isolation is one thing 
but in film and comics contextual knowledge  easily overrides local interpretation a 
good example is this one frame from the  famous museum scene of Hitchcock's Vertigo we 
see the character of Madeleine played by Kim  Novak from behind looking at a painting seen in 
isolation we would categorize it as a proximate  focalization as used in the Casper David Friedrich 
painting on the previous page however when seen in  the context of its actual filmic sequence it 
needs to be interpreted quite differently
 [Music]
 here on page 12 I have decomposed the clip into 10 
frames showing each individual shot the proximate  point of view shot presented on the previous page 
comes up as frame number six in the storyboard  however now that we have seen it in context we 
know that the scene is oriented not on Madeleine  but on a different reflector it is Scottie played 
by James Stewart the ex-detective whose job it  is to secretly observe Madeleine supposedly 
the wife of a friend the sequence consists  of alternating external views of Scottie and 
direct point of view shots of what he perceives  we get several views of the reflector's face and 
body and they are either so-called gaze shots as  in frames 1 and 7 or reaction shots as in frames 
3 7 and 10 bracketed by the external shots are  the direct point of view shots 2 6 8 and 9. I 
have again distributed letters R and O to mark  reflector and object of attention the external 
shots are now labeled external-R recognizing them  as parts of the scene's overall reflector mode
but the  decomposition also challenges our understanding 
of the reflector's mindset as the external views  connect us to the direction of Scottie's sight 
the point of view shots let us see what he is  interested in we know that Scottie has fallen in 
love with Madeleine and the persistent musical  motif that accompanies the action accentuates 
his mood of fascination and wonderment  foremost in his mind are the same questions that 
we are asking ourselves why is she behaving so  oddly what is her interest in the painting and 
what's the relevance of that bouquet of flowers  much later we learn that she is only playacting 
Madeleine isn't even her real name and it is  a playacting that relies on the gut reaction of 
transposition to achieve its intended deception  and the deception does its work both on the 
reflector and the recipients one of Hitchcock's  often quoted comments is that he enjoyed playing 
his audience like a piano in this case we see  that there are two players Madeleine who plays 
Scottie and the director who plays the recipients 
 that's the end of the video and hopefully it has 
served its purpose as a brief introduction even  if only by scratching the surface remember notes 
and references are accessible from the description  if any of this has caught your interest here 
is a possible to-do list I'll say goodbye at  this point thanks very much for your patience 
any comments good or bad are very welcome

Video script [Music]hellowelcome to postcolonial space i'm masoodrajaand today i'll start a new serieson narratologyokay and the reason i am starting it isof course a friend requested it but alsoimyself am not really familiar withnarratology and narrative theory so ithoughtif i prepare for these lectures i willlearn something new and then i'll beable to sharesomething new as well so today intoday's video i will briefly beintroducing what narratology is how canit be definedand then eventually in further videos iwillshare with you works of differentstructuralist theorists andothers who have tried to definenarratology and itspractice now to be clearthis is the book and i'll post the linkin the description that i'm using as aguideto learn the basic concept of conceptsof narratologyand narrative theory and then of coursei've already read so many of thescholars that they use here butyou know to articulate what exactlycertain things mean within heretologythis is the book i'll be usingi highly recommend it the book comeswith a very extensive introduction thatgives you the ideathe history and the description ofnarratology itselfand then it gives you different chapterswhich are actuallyexcerpts from major theorists andwriterswho have worked on narrative theory ornarratologyso here let's start with how the editorsdefine itwhat are their reasons and what do wegetout of that right now here are somebasics about narratology first of allit's very succinctright which the editors provide us inthe bookthat i mentioned and that i'll cite atthe end of thisright and that is that etymologicallyspeakingnarratology is the science ofnarrative which originally thestructuralist theoristscame up with and we'll talk more aboutthoseit has a wider and a narrower definitionthe wider comes from aristotlewhich is a work with a plot and an erroris a work with a narratorwe work with the second one in literarystudiesand then today it studies narrativeaspects of many genresliterary genres lyrical poems filmsdrama historyand even advertisements and narratologycoverspretty much all these fields so there isnarrative as a mediated enunciation andthere is a distinction between dramaticnarrative and mediatednarrative that we'll talk about becausethe letter has a narratorand then narrative itself is thesemiotic representationof a series of events meaningfullyconnected in a temporaland causal way that is how the editorswhose book is right in front of youdefinenarrative because to know narratology wehave to know what a narrative isokay so in terms of the definition thatit is anetymologically speaking it is a scienceof study of narratives so you alreadyprobably know what etymology is it isthe studyof history of the words but here wecould basically assumethat what they mean is that in terms ofits linguistichistorical designation narratologymeans study scientific studyof narratives then they go on to teachusin this introductory chapter that thepeople who came up witha theorization of this were earlystructuralists people like gerard gennaemike ball gerald prince and i would sayof coursebarth as well andas a result the early understanding ofnarratology was from a structuralistpoint of viewand you know if you don't know whatstructuralism is you can watch mylecture on structuralism but basicallystructuralism is study of literarystructures which is adapted intoliterary studiesafter the linguistic turn aftersasharian linguisticbecomes prominent nowthe editors here what they have done isthey arefirst in the introduction they aredefining their terms so as they justdefinedwhat narratology is then they go on toteach us that there are twoways of looking at neurotology we canhave a wider definitionand then we can have a narrowerdefinition the wider definition they aredrawingfrom you know aristotle's poeticsright and in that for aristotleand they say and i'm quoting plot is thecentral element in a literary worka narrative structure which is common todramatic narrativesgenre proper right so if we gowith a wider rightdefinition ofnarratology or narrativesanything that has a plot right accordingto the editorsis a narrative the narrower version thatthey are talking aboutis is it's it's a story it's it's anarrativeyou know not just a plot but a workwith a narrator right and that's crucialbecause then we are into literarystudies and then we can decide okay ifthisthing doesn't have a narrator is it anarrative or notbut the wider one is anything that has aplotand the narrower one is a plot with thenarratorand then they go into narrative as amediated enunciation what do they meanby itsimply so enunciation is an act ofspeakingby mediated enunciation they mean isthat any workthat has someone a narrator who isenunciating what's happening in the plotso hence hasa narrator so by that definitionthings that don't have that mediationthrough a narratoror through something that enunciates therealityto us that cannot beprobably studied as a narrativelet's give you an example they give youthe example of dramaas unmediated rightand thenall the other forms you know thatdoesn't that are non-dramatic but let'ssay fictionyou know as as a mediated formso the difference is drama when theytalk about it basically you're talkingabout live stage play in which the playis right therethe players speak the actors speak andyouare the one who receive it and it'sunmediated because no one is tryingto tell you what to construewhose point of view is it right you'rejust watching itmediated enunciation is when there is afigureof a narrator right or if it's filmthere are camera angles there is adirector right who'sanother aspect of it is that the dramaan unmediated representation canconstantly change anytime a drama isstagedby different actors by differentdirectors it can have different emphasisdifferent meanings as a narrativestructurebut if it has been rendered into a filmit becomes a fixednarrative right and hence we can studyitbut this is the reason for explainingthe mediated and unmediated uhenunciations right and it will becomeimportant you know as we studymore of narratology and narrativeanalysisthen we go out to you know i'm not goingto relymore on their further description but iam going to go to how they define thenarrativeso as i put it in the slides thenarrative is the semiotic representationof a series of eventsmeaningfully connected in a temporaland causal way so let's unpack thatright first of all it's a semioticrepresentationwhich means what is a semiotic arepresentation in science rightin verbal science in written science soit's a semiotic representationof something righta series of events which areintentionally and meaningfully connectedto one anotherright and they are connected to oneanotherin time in serial timeand there are causal connections fromone to the otherright and that constitutesa narrative now it can be a novelit can be a film rightit can be you know a linguisticnarrative it can be a theatricalnarrative a pictorial narrative afilmic narrative butall of those to constitute a narrativewill have what they suggest a semioticrepresentationof a series of events meaningfullyconnected togetherright meaningfully in timeand through some kind of causality rightand then they will gointo explaining each of these aspects ofit you know what is the relevancewhat is the aspects ofrepresented object what is the criteriaof relevance between oneobject or the other but at this pointsince this is just the very beginning ofitwhat we understand by narrative issimply that it's a semioticrepresentationof a series of events meaningfullyconnected in a temporal andcausal way now the reason it's importantto understand thatis just like any other scholars thesepeople are first trying to ground usinto understandingwhat their understanding of narrative isthen they will expand itadd different layers to it rightand then it will become easier for us tounderstand whatnarrative theory is why dostructuralists do the things they doif we don't know what a narrative is andhow to define itclearly then we won't understand whatdifferent structuralist theoristsor anyone else feminists and others aredoing with narrativeso that's all i have today so let's kindofgo over it you know the editor firstgaveus that narratologyis the science of studyingnarrative okay there are widernarratives as defined by aristotlewhich is that anything with a plot is anarrative and then there arethere's a narrower definition and thatis of narratology and that is studyinganything that has a narratorright that is crucial to us because westudy literaturebut by declaring that it must have anarratorwe are also eliminating certain thingsthat might not have a narrativeand stage play let's say is one of themrightand then they go into that mediated andunimediate andmediated enunciation so a live stageplay becomes anunmediated enunciation hence may notqualifyas a narrative for study whereasa novel a short story even a narrativepoemis mediated through the point of view ofthe narrator righthence might constitute a narrativeworthy of our studyand then they give us a clear definitionof narrativethat i repeated several times earlierkeeping these things in mindright when i come to you next timewe will go as to how the editors of thisparticular book further complicatenarratology as a scienceof study of narratives and why it isimportant for us to learnas literary critics as critics of textsand worksthat's all i have today thank you somuch i'll see you next timeand if you have any questions pleasepost them in the comments if i missedsomethinglet me know and i'll try to explain itbetter and then i'll be backwith the next lecture on narratologyor narrative criticism that's all thankyouand as always peace and love

Video script hi today i'm going to talk to you verybrieflyabout one of the most important orfoundational distinctions in narrativetheoryand that's the difference in a narrativebetweenstory and discourse verybasically put the idea is that when welook at any narrativewe have the story which is what happensor our conception of what this thing isabout usually that conception ischronological as welldiscourse is the telling of a story theway the story is put togetherand presented to us all you have to dois think abouta movie or a book that you've seenrecently and you could probably begin tosee thisbasic divide between the telling of astorythe discourse and the story itself theaboutness aboutness is a great word thati love to usethink about the hunger games what's thestory of the hunger games i'm sure youcould tell itbasically in the future in apost-apocalyptic worldthese people have been oppressed thepeople in the capital are in control inorder to keep them in control they havethese things called hunger gamesthe story goes on but if you think aboutthe way that the story is presented tous the discoursein the novel we have an opening scene inwhich katniss is running around huntinganimalsshe's thinking about her sister we'renot really sure what's going onso the story is presented to us in aperhaps non-chronological way some ofthe facts that welearn about the country are providedthrough flashback or throughother stories so that's the discoursethe way it has been given tous just compare it to the movie and youcan see that discourse distinction againthe movie the discourse begins withpeople sitting on stage saying we'rereally excited the hunger games areabout to startso the story is presented to us in adifferent way the discourseis different the story is the samewhat's interesting is that we think ofstory as something that's out therestory exists it's the aboutness of athingwe can all talk about what the story isin a narrativebut that the discourse puts it intoaction gives it to usthat's a little bit strange when youthink about it because it's almostassuming as ifstories are out there just waiting to betoldbut we know that our lives aren'tpackaged into a storythey don't become stories until we addthe discourse that to a certain extentstory can'texist without the telling of a storyi think this is an important thing tothink about it's important for tworeasons first of all in terms ofnarrative theory it allows us to sort ofcategorize things and look at things inparticular ways we can say oh let'stalk about the story what is this storyit's eventsit's characters for exampleor we can talk about the discourse howis this given to us throughflashback and flash forward orforeshadowinghow is it actually constructed so itallows us thatnarrative insight or a way to talk aboutnarrativethe other reason is it's important is ithink it gives us a little window intothe textwe're studying think aboutan invisible sign of my own it's easy todetectsigns of discourse signs of the way thatthis is being told to usbut what's the story i think if youconsider for a moment what the story isyou might realize what the importance ofdiscourse in this particular example iswe're going to talk about it more thisweek there's a reading that you can dothat will hopefully clarify some of thisbut i wanted to justcreate a video because it's really funthanks

Video script In Meditations, Marcus Aurelius said, “don’t
waste the rest of your time here worryingabout other people—unless it affects the
common good.It will keep you from doing anything useful.You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so
is doing, and why, and what they’re saying,and what they’re thinking, and what they’re
up to, and all the other things that throwyou off and keep you from focusing on your
own mind.”In my opinion, Marcus touches on the main
issue that holds people back in life: beingattached to what other people think of them.So I’m gonna explore this idea through a
dialogue.---
In Shinjuku, when the clock strikes midnight,a small bar opens up for a few hours.Few people visit it, but the one’s who go
know what they’re looking for.Tonight, Himari takes a seat alone, and after
a few drinks, she has the following conversationwith the bartender.B: “If you’re attached to what other people
think of you, you’ll never do anything trulyuseful.”H: “What do you mean?”B: “If you’re attached to what other people
think of you, you’ll never be yourself.And if life has taught me anything, it’s
that being yourself is the only truly usefulthing someone can do.”H: “I don’t get it.How is being myself useful?”B: “True usefulness comes from being what
you are.Think about a tree: its fruits and oxygen
are a byproduct of it being itself.The same holds true for us.We do useful things by being ourselves.”H: “But aren’t I always myself?”B: “You’re getting stuck in language.Let’s look at the tree again.Several things can stop the tree from being
itself such as a lack of sunlight, a lackof water, and lots of competition in the environment.There are obstacles stopping the tree from
being.So being yourself is the same as overcoming
your own obstacles.And one of the greatest obstacles to being
yourself is being attached to what other peoplethink of you.”H: “How does being attached to what other
people think of me stop me from being myself?”B: “When you are being yourself, you have
to be willing to violate people’s expectationsof you.You have to be willing to disappoint them.You have to be willing for them to react negatively.But someone who’s attached to what other
people think of them is not willing to takethat risk, so they end up being who others
want them to be rather than being themselves.”H: “I guess you’re right.But what can I do?I depend on what people think of me to survive.”B: “So you’re attached to what people
think of you because you’re dependent ontheir opinion for security.But if your relationship depends on satisfying
someone’s expectations, it’s not a realrelationship.You are a prisoner to someone’s idea of
you.”H: “That’s true, but there’s still security
in a prison.”B: “Yes, but you’re in a prison.You’ve traded the whole of your life for
security.What is there left to secure?”H: “Hmm I guess that’s true.I never thought about it.But no matter what I do, or where I go, I’ll
always depend on people’s opinions for security!That’s how the world is, isn’t it.”B: “If you sell water in a desert, does
it matter what people think of you?If you can truly produce something of value,
their opinions do not matter.”H: “I guess you’re right.But how do I make something of value?”B: “That’s like asking how the tree makes
its fruit.I’ll put it like this: a tree is imprisoned
by a lack of water, sunlight, and competition.When the tree breaks out of these prisons,
when it becomes completely free, the fruitis the natural outcome.It’s not about how you can produce something
of value, but how you can become free.When you break free of all your prisons, your
fruit comes of its own accord.”---
Marcus Aurelius said that caring about whatother people think would prevent you from
doing anything useful, and I explored themeaning behind this idea through a dialogue.The most useful thing someone can do is be
themselves.And what we truly are can never be put into
words.Whether we think we are good, bad, an artist,
or a lawyer, what we are can never be boileddown to a single word.When we say, “I am a wife,” or “a mother,”
or “a musician,” or “a lawyer,” we’retaking one tiny sliver of our memory and identifying
ourselves with it.We’re more than our memories.Being yourself is the same as overcoming your
own problems, and truly overcoming your ownproblems is what allows you to help others
overcome theirs—which is why true valuelies in being oneself.But as long as we’re attached to what other
people think of us, we will always be whatpeople want us to be rather than being ourselves.And if we abandon ourselves, we abandon our
ability to be truly useful to the world.And if we abandon our ability to be truly
useful to the world, we abandon what is perhapsthe only form of true security.On the other hand, when we be what other people
want us to be, we have the security of a prisoner,which is security in exchange for life—and
that’s really not any security at all.But at the end of the day, this is just my
opinion and understanding of Marcus’ words,not advice.Feel free to use this information however
you like, and if you have a different takeon Marcus’ words, I’d love to hear your
perspective in the comments.

Video script today we're going to talk about judgmentin a really deep and complex way but bythe end of this video a lot more thingsare going to make a lot more sense andyou were going to be a whole lot lessworried about being judged now thisvideo isn't gonna be that long but it isgonna be deep and the concepts that I'mteaching are a little bit more advancedand some of it might make your brainhurt a little bit I might make it mighttake a little bit longer to wrap yourhead around these concepts so watch thisvideo more than once if the first timeyou watch it it doesn't quite connectbut understanding judgment in this wayis a really powerful way to stopworrying so much about being judgedare you ready if you're new here welcometo our amazing little corner on theInternet take a second introduceyourself in the comments section belowand make sure you subscribe to thechannel so we can stay connected and ifyou are back again I am so glad that youare here welcome back either way my nameis Julia Kristina and I'm a registeredclinical therapist a research researchera coach and the greater of thebreakthrough coaching program of amaster's degree in counseling psychologyand it worked to help heart centergo-getter men and women break throughthe crap that is holding them backso that they can like themselves andtheir lives more every day and judgmentis a big thing that holds us back thisfear about what other people might thinkabout us the perception or perspectivethat they might have of us that we don'twant them to have and so we use thatoften as a reason to not do the thingsthat we want to do to not take the risksthat we want to take to not show upfully and authentically as ourselvesbecause we don't know what other peopleare going to think how other people aregoing to take it how other people aregoing to perceive it and so we keepourselves held back and I'm hoping thattoday as I explained judgment to you ina completely different way that youprobably haven't heard before I hopethat it changes something in your brainI'm not going to tell you that you needto go out and do a bunch of stuff I'mgoing to ask you to sinkabout things in a different way and thegoal is is when you have this differentunderstanding it's gonna stop judgmentfrom having that level of hold on youthat it's not going to be able to holdyou back and so first of all let's talkabout judgment when it as it pertains tothe other person so we fear what peopleare going to think about us theperceptions that they're going to havethe the assessments that they're gonnamake of us but what we need tounderstand about judgment is that whensomeone has a judgment it is not aboutus it is about their own repressed orrejected parts of themselves the thingsthat they feel insecure about the thingsthat they don't like about themselvesthat they have rejected or keep and keepkept hidden in the shadows it's part ofthe Jungian psychology it's called theshadow self and we all have it we allhave a shadow these parts of ourselvesthat we try to keep hidden that we tryto push aside but they come out in thesesubconscious ways through judgment sosomeone's judgement of you actually hasnothing to do with you it is their ownjudgments of themselves that they areprojecting on to you so that's the firstpart knowing that someone else'sjudgments are about them so when someonesays oh that's you know that that's notabout you that's about them that's whatthat means that it really truly is sothen the second part and this part mightbe a little bit tougher to hear but itis so important that we understand thisoften we think that we fear otherpeople's judgments no matter whether itis if it's about them if it's about uswho cares but we fear their judgementbut the truth is we don't actually feartheir judgment we don't fear what theythink we fear what we're going to makethat mean so the judgmentyou fear from others have nothing to dowith them and are only about the thingsthat you are struggling with inside ofyou so let's think about this for asecond there are certain things that youthink about that you worry about thatyou maybe stress about that someone elsecould judge you for that someone elsecould have an opinion about you that youdon't want them to have about certainparts of yourself and then there's otherparts of yourself that you could careless it wouldn't even occur to you thatsomeone could judge you about that thingbecause it's not something that youstruggle with so this the parts ofyourself that you feel good about thatyou feel secure in that you feelcomfortable and confident about withinyourself it doesn't even occur to youthat someone could judge you about thosethings the only judgments that we fearfrom others are the things that we arestruggling with already within ourselveswithin our own self concept within ourown idea about who we are so if you feellike you are smart you are competent youare capable you are attractive you aregood at what you do you're a good personlike whatever that is you're not goingto worry about anyone judging you aboutthose things because it doesn't evenoccur to you that they could but if youdon't feel smart enough if you don'tfeel good enough if you don't feelconfident enough or capable enough orsuccessful enough or beautiful enough orstrong enough or good enough person thenyou are gonna fear that other people aregoing to judge you about any of thosethings so here's what judgment actuallyis in a nutshell judgement is the fearof someone else's judgments ofthemselves because of what we're goingto make it mean about the judgments wehave of ourselves judgment has nothingto do with anyone else it has to do withus on both sides of the spectrum so howdo we deal with it what do we do aboutitwe work on our relationship withourselves we work on healing our owninsecurities dealing with our owninsecurities cleaning up the inside sothat those things that we worry aboutbeing judged about they are no longerissues for us and then we won't fearbeing judged about them so cleaning upour thoughts judgment in the fear ofjudgement has nothing to do with anyoneelse and getting past the fear ofjudgment has nothing to do with anyoneelseit has to do with us it's an inside joband it's not about perfecting ourselvesright that's where perfectionism willcome in and lie to us and say well likeif you're perfect then you won't bejudged and that's just not truebecause if you try to be perfect thenyou're going to be constantly worriedabout what other people are going tothink because you're constantly tryingto be someone in order to control theirthoughts so that you can manage your owndo you see how that works as soon aswe're trying to get other people to seeus a certain way so that we can be okayall of our sense of self-worth is in thehands of someone else and it's a relianton them and as we know their opinionsare not even about us their judgmentsare not even about us they are aboutthem so it's all turns into a bit of adisaster if that's going to be ourstrategy so cleaning up our relationshipwith ourselves learning to love andaccept ourselves for who we are and whatwe are and where we are and yesacknowledging that we all have room togrowand things to work on in areas to healbut that's just part of life that's notabout becoming good enough that's justabout being human if this is somethingthat you want to work on I have a freedownload for you it's called thecommitted self journal and this is gonnabe an exercise so it's a full processit's a free document but it's a reallyreally powerful process to take yourselfthrough to really be focusing on what doyou want to be working on or dealingwith or moving towards and it's gonnawalk you through a process in order todo that if there's some things that youneed to clean up some stuff that youwant to be moreon within you not on the outside on theinside then grab that committed selfjournal if you liked this video can Iask you to like it to share it out toanyone that you think might find thisuseful or anyone who you want to givetheir brain a little bit of a run forits money by introducing them to a wayof looking at judgment that is reallyultimately completely freeing

Video script hello everyone thank you for joining meagain and welcome to any new viewersthis is to the point English with BenI'm Ben and in this video I'm going toexplain how to tell a story in Englishand in particular how to use thenarrative tenses now I know what youmight be thinkingum you have no plans on writing a bookright you're not planning a career inliterature so why do you need to knowhow to tell a story well first of all ifyou're planning on taking an Englishexam you'll need to know how to tell astory effectively for example if youneed to write a review of a book or afilm you need to basically tell thestory in in summary form of that book ofor film or maybe you have to write anarticle about a personal experience likeyour favorite holiday and you need totell the story so to speak of thatholiday but apart from that we doactually tell stories every day maybethey're just mundane little anecdotesabout things that have happened to us sofor example here's a little mundaneanecdote for you I just saw my oldschool friend Dave at the shoppingcenter he was buying a present for hiswife and had been walking around forhours it was good to bump into him I hadlast seen him in 2009okay so as you can see that's not aparticularly interesting or elaboratestory it's very mundane very day-to-daybut in that little short story I usedall of the narrative tenses in inEnglish now I do want to emphasize thatnarrative tenses are not some specialsecret tenses that we only use forstorytelling they are simply Four Pasttenses which are very useful when wewant to tell a story and really explainwhat we want to say effectively and thefour tenses are the past simple the pastcontinuousthe past perfect and the past perfectcontinuousso with those four verb tenses you cantell any story you want to tellbasically from a Shakespearean tragedyor just a mundane anecdote like I justtold so to form the past perfect youjust need to use the auxiliary hadso the past of have as an auxiliary verband then the past participle of the mainverb so had gone had been had worked Etcand for the past perfect continuous youalso need to use the auxiliary had plusthe past participle form of the verb beso in this case bin is the pastparticiple of Band then the ing form of the main verbso had been working had been doing hadbeen trying for example so let's lookagain at that little anecdote I just sawmy old school friend Dave at theshopping center so I just saw so I sawis the past simple so we use the pastsimple to refer to an action whichstarted and finished in the past it hasno connection to any other action in thepast or present or future and then Isaid he was buying a present for hiswife so that's the past continuous ofcourse so we use the past continuous torefer to actions which are taking placebefore during and possibly after thetime when the story is taking place theaction of seeing Dave started andfinished in a very short period but hewas buying a present for his wifecontinued for longer but then I said hehad been walking around for hoursso in that case it's the past perfectcontinuous and we use the past perfectcontinuous to describe an action whichstarted before another action in thepast and continued up to that other pastaction and I'm really emphasizing thathe had been walking around for a longtime and then I said I had last seen himin 2009 so that's the past perfectsimple so that's referring to a pastaction which happens before another pastaction which is also referenced in thestory or the anecdote or the sentencenow it may be in relation to anotherpast action or just a past timereference in this case you know thewhole story is happening in the pastright I saw Dave in the shopping centerthat sets the time it was in the pastand all these other actions happen inrelation to that past action so as youcan see there's quite a lot of grammarin a very simple and basic mundaneboring anecdote reallynow I'm going to give you a much longeranecdote a longer story and this is atrue story from when I was quite youngand while I'm telling this anecdote Iwant you to spot as many of thenarrative tenses as possible that I useand then we're going to see it writtenon the screen so you can check if youspotted them all when I was 18 I took agap year with the intention of spendingthe whole year in Australia with acouple of friends I had never beenoutside of Europe before so I wasextremely eager to go I was living withmy parents at the time but I needed toearn money to pay for the flights andaccommodation so I got a job in afactory I had been working for just twoweeks when it dawned on me that weneeded to apply for a Visa in order tostay in Australia but we had left it toolate so we changed our plans and decidedto go to Spain for six months InsteadThis was pre-brexit by the way we flewto Malaga and took a bus along the coaststopping in towns along the way we hadbeen traveling for three days when westarted to feel homesick and we stoppedin Gibraltar for a few nights in orderto connect with the Home Country afterso long away after that we went back upthe coast to Toro Molinos where westayed in a cheap apartment for fiveweeks and drank on the beach every dayuntil we ran out of money and went homeso what was supposed to be a year inAustralia ended up being about six weeksin the south of Spainbut it was a great experience andcuriously one of my friends now lives inAustralia and I now live in Spain sothat travel bug obviously stayed with usall these years so did you identify allthe different narrative tenses soremember we're looking for the the pastsimple the past continuous the pastperfect and the past perfect continuouswell let's have a look at that anecdotein text now and as you can see I'vehighlighted the different verb tenses indifferent colors so we have the pastsimple in red the past continuous inblue the past perfect in that kind oforange yellow color and the past perfectcontinuous in green so if you want topause the video now just to to rereadthat text and see how I've used thosenarrative tenses to tell this littlestory so as I said this is not thatShakespeare it's not particularlycreative or inventive it's just ananecdote but I did use all of thenarrative tenses and they really helpedme to express what I wanted to sayeffectively and it helps the flow of thestory and the reader or The Listener canreally get a feel for when thesedifferent actions were happening inrelation to the rest of the story so ofcourse the whole story was in the pastso we use the past simple for the mainevents but everything that happensaround the story so usually before orduringyou have to use the different verbtenses so either the past continuous thepast perfect or the past perfectcontinuous so as I said these verbtenses The Narrative tenses areextremely useful for every everydayEnglish but also particularly useful ifyou're taking an English exam especiallythe Cambridge English exams okay shareyour own examples in the comments checkout these videos to watch next theycontain a lot of useful tips and I'llsee you very soon for another video

Video script greetings and welcome to All Thingsphysics where we circle around andaround trying to understand the detailsof how the world workstoday I want to discuss a question thatsurprisingly subtle and most people endup getting it wrong including physicistscheck it outimagine an object being swung around ona string so that it moves in uniformcircular motionthe question we want to answer is whatpath does the object take immediatelyafter releasing the stringto narrow things down a bit I'll giveyou three choicesdoes the object a continue moving incircular motionB move along a straight line pathtangent to the release pointor C move in a straight line pathdirectly away from the center of thecircleI'll give you a few moments to think itover and choose an answerat this point I assume you've got ananswer in mind so I'd like to begin byrevealing that answer B is generallyconsidered to be the correct answer butin reality it turns out to be wrongnow I know many of you are probablythinking what how is that possiblewell hopefully by the end of this videoI'll have you convinced that anotheranswer is indeed correctbefore discussing why answer B isincorrect let's first take a look atanswer Csome of you might think that this answeris obviously wrong but it's not asstrange as you might think it alldepends on your perspectivelet me explainwhat you're looking at here is a smallplastic Puck sitting on a platform thatcan rotatenotice that as I rotate the platform themass moves in circular motionthis situation is similar to swinging aball around on a string with frictionplaying the role of the stringif we rotate the platform faster andfaster there comes a point when the massbegins to slide which is similar toreleasing the stringbut what do we observe if we happen tobe on the rotating platforminitially the puck remains Motionlessbut once we reach a high enoughrotational speed we see that the puckmoves away from the center of theplatform and curves off to the leftalthough it's a little hard to see ifyou look closely it looks like the puckinitially moves directly away from thecenter of the platformin fact if we neglect air resistancethen one can show mathematically thatthis is precisely what's happeningthus you can make a strong argument thatanswer C is in fact the correct answerassuming of course that you happen to beviewing the situation from a rotatingframehowever even in a rotating frame andneglecting air resistance answer C turnsout to be incorrect for the same reasonthat b is incorrectand by now you're probably reallycurious why answer a turns out to be thecorrect answerbefore moving on it's worth mentioningthat the trajectory of the puck on arotating platform is governed by thecentrifugal force and the Coriolis Forcewhich can give rise to some veryinteresting motionsthese forces are sometimes calledfictitious forces though this termdownplays the very real effects youexperience if you're in the rotatingframegiven that we live on a rotating Planetit's actually critically important tounderstand how to determine the motionof an object in such a framethe process is relativelystraightforward but the details arebetter left to a future videoto understand why the ball continuesalong its curved trajectory immediatelyafter the string is released let's firstthink about something really simple adropped ballas you would expect there's nothingterribly interesting here the moment theball is released it begins acceleratingtoward the groundbut things are not quite so simple if welook at a more complex object such asthis Slinky hanging from one enddropped slinkies have been very popularon YouTube so you may already knowwhat's going to happen but if you'venever seen it before the phenomenon ispretty strikingnotice how the bottom of the slinkyremains motionless after the top isreleasedit almost appears as though the slinkysomehow defies the laws of physicsit doesn't of courseNewton's second law says that the netexternal force on the system is equal tothe mass of the system times theacceleration of the system's Center ofmassthe slinky Center of mass will behaveexactly like the dropped ballto verify this is the case shown here isa slinky and a ball dropped at thelocation of the slinky's initial Centerof mass accompanied by a simulation of adropped Slinky along with its calculatedCenter of massas you can see the slinky Center of massbehaves exactly as predicted by Newton'ssecond lawwhat's causing the interesting Behaviorhere is the fact that there are internalforces at Playin addition to gravity acting on eachcoil in the slinky there's also atension force from the slinky itself andthe strength of this tension force islarger when the coils are more spreadoutthe coil spacing is thus a visualdisplay of the tension in the slinkyfor a hanging Slinky we can see that thetension is larger near the top whichmakes sense when you consider that alarger tension is needed to support alarger fraction of the slinky's totalweightnow before the slinky is released theforces are balanced and each point ofthe slinky is in equilibrium but oncereleased the force is at the top becomeunbalanced so the top of the slinkybegins to acceleratethis acceleration leads to a change intension that then propagates through theslinky as a longitudinal wavethus each point on the slinky remains inequilibrium until the tension wavearrivesfor a slinky this wave speed appears tobe roughly constant and in ourparticular case we find an approximatespeed of 3.3 meters per secondinterestingly for a slinky the motion ofthe collapsing coils and the motion ofthe tension wave appear to coincidealmost exactlythus the collapsing coils essentiallymarks the position of the tension wavethere's no reason this has to be thecase so the motion of a drop Slinky issomewhat special in this regard and mayvery well be one of the reasons whydropped slinkies Are So Beautiful towatchwe'll return to this interesting pointlater in the videoso what does all this have to do withthe question about circular motionwell imagine connecting a ball to thebottom of the slinkynot surprisingly the same phenomenon isobservedI don't know about you but even thoughthis behavior is expected I still findit pretty extraordinary to see the balllevitating in the air like thisbut if we now imagine the ball beingswung around in circular motion on theend of the slinky then what happens whenthe slinky is releasedwill the ball remain moving in circularmotion while the tension wave propagatesthrough the slinkysomehow this just doesn't seem possiblein order to answer this question wetravel to High Point University in NorthCarolina to meet up with some colleagueswho had previously investigated thissituationthe setup is not trivial because youneed to mount a high-speed camera wellabove the experiment which then requiresa lot of lightfortunately we were given access to theUniversity's Theater which was an ideallocation for the experimentwow[Music]thank you[Music]foreign[Music]s for traveling to High Point Universityis because they have a mechanical devicethat can be used to spin things aroundand release them with the Press of abuttonhere's Jeff register explaining how itworks so basically the whole reasonwe're here is to use this really coolContraptionum can you explain how this works yeahit's a it's a turntable so spins aroundup to about four revolutions per secondand uh under control from my phone theelectronics here it can do variousthings and what we're going to use itfor today is to release a spring whilethe whole thing's spinning we're goingto release a spring and it does that bya little Servo motor here pulls out andreleases a spring-loaded bar which dropsthis bar will drop about releasing theobject I get it yes and you built thisfrom scratch right I did some years agoI I built it because I put together ateam NASA had put out a uh a call forproposals for experiments to fly ontheir zero gravity aircraft that's whythe NASA sticker there did you what Ibuild it NASA didn't build it did youactually fly on that I I did that thatzero gravity airplane this is the thisis that airplane that does the parabolasbut uh this got the fly and I got to flyon on the Zero Gravity aircraft that'scool yeahokay so I think everything's basicallyset up the way this is going to workwe've got the rotating table here withthe slinky on board and on this Battenwe've mounted a high speed camera facingstraight down to film this from aboveand the Batten can be moved up or downas neededmeanwhile the camera is connected viathese cables that go over to thiscomputer workstation allowing us tocontrol everything remotelynow that everything is ready to go it'stime to observe what actually happenshere's a ball being swung around on theend of a slinkyviewed from above it's clear that theball's trajectory is indeed a circlebut notice how the slinky is angledbackward from where you might expect anddoes not point to the center of thecirclethis is due to a non-negligible Air dragthis drag angle results in a tensionforce that has both a tangentialcomponent to balance Air drag and aradial component that supplies the forceneeded to maintain the centripetalacceleration that keeps the ball movingin circular motionthus even though air dry cannot beneglected in this system the constantdrag angle allows the system to maintaina kind of dynamic equilibrium as theball continues movingbut what happens when the slinky isreleasedafter all that's what we came here tofind outlet's take a lookback up a little bit okay okay now playitso right here is where the slinky isreleased but it's clearly going incircular motion still that is awesome asis evident in this video when the slinkyis released the ball continues moving incircular motion until the tension wavehas traveled all the way to the end ofthe slinkyalthough this phenomenon is essentiallythe same as what's happening with a dropSlinky most people find it even moresurprising to see it happen when the netforce on the ball is not zerobut even if you understand what's goingon and fully expect the ball to continuemoving in circular motion it's stillquite remarkable to actually see it playout in a real physical systemI mean come on you got to admit thatthis is pretty amazingof course the original questiondiscusses swinging a ball around on astring not a slinkyso let's consider something a littlemore string likeshown here is a weighted tennis ballhanging from a colorful stretchy noodlemade of thermoplastic rubberjust like the slinky when the noodle isreleased the ball remains motionless fora short time as the tension wavepropagates to the bottomin fact if you watch carefully you cansee something really interesting goingonit's a bit easier to see if we Orientthe video horizontallynotice that when the noodle is stretchedit becomes thinner so you can actuallysee the tension wave propagate as achange in thicknessinterestingly unlike the slinky thetension wave propagates more quicklythan the noodle itself and this speed ismuch faster than the tension wave in theslinkyand of course if we swing the ballaround in circular motion we shouldn'tbe surprised to see that the ballmaintains this circular motion for ashort time after being releasedwe can take things one step further andlook at something even more string-likesuch as an elastic cordthe speed of the tension wave is evenfaster in an elastic cord so it's morechallenging to observehere I've again oriented the videohorizontally and I've also zoomed in toshow a section of the chord that haslines drawn on iteven still things happen very quickly soit's helpful to slowly step through thevideo to see exactly what's going onif you watch carefully you can see thelines on the elastic cord become blurryas the tension wave passes byand thus just like with the slinky andthe noodle when the ball is moving incircular motion and the chord isreleased the ball continues in circularmotion for a brief period of timething using a string but the tensionwave moves so fast that it's verydifficult to capture it on videohere's a mass hanging by a string andcovered by a balloon to make it easierto seeif we step through the video frame byframe you can see there's a tiny bit ofmotion occurring only at the top of thestring which is almost immediatelyfollowed by motion at the bottom of thestringbecause we have so few frames to workwith we can only estimate that thetension wave propagates at a speedsomewhere between fifteen hundred andthree thousand meters per secondunfortunately this very large wave speedmakes it impossible for us to capturethe ball continuing to move in circularmotion upon release like we did for theslinky Noodle and elastic cordbut hopefully I've already convinced youof the answer to our original questionimmediately after releasing the string aball being swung around in circularmotion will continue moving in circularmotion albeit only for a very brief timeI don't know about you but I find thisphenomenon to be quite fascinatingof course for a string length of onemeter the ball is only going to continuein circular motion for about half amillisecond after being released so youmight think the effect on its trajectoryis going to be relatively smallin fact you might consider thetrajectory to be well approximated by astraight line tangent to the releasepoint and to some extent this is truehowever the effect we've been discussingis larger than you might imaginefor example if the ball is being swungaround with a frequency of 4 Hertz andhas launched a total distance of 10meters the ball will actually end upmore than 12 centimeters laterally fromwhere you would expect it to be if itwas moving tangent to the release pointthat's surprisingly significantand finally let me leave you with onelast thoughtimagine that somehow the sun were tocompletely disappear from existenceaccording to general relativitygravitational changes travel at thespeed of light so the Earth would notfeel the effects of that for about 8.3minutestherefore Not only would we continue tosee late from the Sun for the next eightminutes but Earth would continue movingin circular motion for the next eightminutes isn't that crazyand with that I'll bring this video to acloseI'm David Jackson and this is all

Video script “Of all the equations of physics, perhaps 
the most magical is the Dirac equation.”Remarked MIT physics professor Frank Wilczek.Paul Dirac believed that the 
fundamental laws governing theuniverse could be expressed 
through “pretty mathematics”When he wrote down an equation to describe 
the electront, he noticed something odd.His equation predicted the existence of 
antimatter - the mirror image of matter.If matter is like the salt flats 
of the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia,antimatter emerges as its reflection, revealing 
the mysterious symmetry of the universe.Dirac predicted the existence of the antimatter 
counterpart to the electron, the positron.Subatomic particles with the same 
mass as electrons that carry apositive electric charge in contrast 
to the electron’s negative charge.If the two come into contact, they annihilate 
each other, converting both particles into energy.For a man best described as 
an agnostic, he remarked,“God is a mathematician of a very high order.”Dirac was a lonely man who grew up 
a lonely boy and this had a profoundimpact on his personality and possibly 
also his work as a theoretical physicist.He told a colleague, “I never 
knew love or affection when Iwas a child,” as described in the book 
“The Strangest Man” by Graham Farmelo.Paul Dirac’s father, Charles, insisted his three 
children speak to him in his native French.At dinner, Paul would sit in the living room 
eating with his father, while his older brotherFelix and younger sister Betty ate in the kitchen, 
having dinner with their British mother Florence.When Paul mispronounced a word 
in French or misgendered a noun,his father punished him by making him stay 
put, even if he felt like throwing up.Paul Dirac reflected, “Since I found 
that I couldn’t express myself in French,it was better for me to stay silent.”He remained quiet into adulthood. 
Preferring to work alone.He spoke so little that his 
colleagues jokingly defineda unit called a "Dirac" as one word per hour.Charles’ strict educational regime at 
home mirrored how he taught French atthe Merchant Venturer’s School in 
Bristol, where Paul was a student.World War One indirectly benefited Paul; as the 
older students left for military service, it freedup space and resources for him to advance through 
the upper classes, accelerating his learning.His father insisted that he and his brother 
study engineering at Merchant Venturer’s College,which was eventually absorbed 
by the University of Bristol.However, Paul was not cut out for 
such a life; one summer spent as atrainee engineer in a factory resulted in a 
report describing him as a “positive menace”When he failed to find employme nt upon 
graduation owing to the serious post-wareconomic depression, his father suggested 
he study at the University of Cambridge.Dirac secured a spot, but couldn’t get 
a big enough scholarship to attend.Instead, the head of Bristol University’s 
mathematics department arranged for him toget an applied mathematics degree 
which he finished in two years.When he applied to Cambridge again, he 
was able to secure the financial aidthat he needed, allowing him to enroll 
as a graduate research student in 1923.He was lucky to study under Ralph Fowler, a 
distinguished physicist who introduced Dirac tothe cutting-edge field of quantum mechanics, the 
science of the very small, atoms and particles.Dirac lived and breathed science, even while 
taking long walks by himself on Sundays.Fowler’s lectures on Niels Bohr’s 
theory of the atom fascinated Dirac.Much like planets orbiting 
the sun in a fixed path,Bohr suggested that electrons orbit at 
certain distances from the nucleus of an atom.However, Dirac noticed that Bohr's ideas 
didn't fully explain how electrons behavedin atoms more complex than hydrogen, 
nor did it consider how electrons actwhen moving very fast, as described by 
Einstein's special theory of relativity.While Paul was developing his 
own theories at Cambridge,his brother Felix was toiling 
away at a factory in Birmingham.Wondering would might have been had he 
followed his own dream of becoming a doctor.Instead, his father forced him into engineering.Miserable, and making little money,Felix’s body was found beside a 
bottle of poison in January 1925.He was 24 years old.Paul was surprised by his parents’ grief, telling 
a friend decades later: “I didn’t know they caredso much…I never knew that parents ought to care 
for their children, but from then on I knew.”Charles Dirac was in such deep grief that his 
doctor advised him to take a year off work.Paul carried on at Cambridge.In the summer of that year, his supervisor, 
Fowler, introduced him to a groundbreakingpaper by German theoretical physicist Werner 
Heisenberg that would change Dirac’s life.Heisenberg proposed a new way of 
understanding atoms, challenging Bohr’smodel of electrons in fixed orbits. 
 
Since the exact paths of electronscannot be measured, he suggested 
focusing on what can be measured,such as the energy levels of electrons.
 
Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics,a mathematical framework to describe 
the jumps between energy levels.Imagine your car going from 0 to 60 miles 
per hour instantly without moving throughintermediate speeds, akin to an electron skipping 
steps as it transitions between energy states.Shortly after, Austrian physicist Erwin 
Schrödinger presented a different view,depicting particles as waves 
spread through space.This model accounts for strange phenomena 
like the double-slit experiment,where electrons act like waves rather than 
particles, creating interference patterns.Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and Schrodinger’s 
wave mechanics are different ways of describingthe same quantum phenomena, like 
reading the same book in two languages.Author Farmelo described their impact 
this way: “Heisenberg and Schrödingerhad knifed a sack of gemstones, and the 
race was on to pick out the diamonds.”Dirac took both their ideas and ran with them.
 
Published in January 1928, the Dirac equationaccurately describes the behavior 
of electrons moving at any speed.The equation introduced spin - a 
quantum property providing particleswith intrinsic angular momentum, much 
like the spin of a planet on its axis.American theoretical physicist John Van 
Vleck likened Dirac’s explanation of spin toYet, within the beauty of the 
Dirac equation lay an anomaly.It allowed for electrons 
to have negative energy.This baffled scientists 
because, in classical physics,the energy of electrons, like that 
of all objects, is always positive.Dirac proposed a bold solution to this conundrum.He suggested the existence of a “sea” of 
negative energy states filled with electrons.Should an electron escape the 
sea by gaining sufficient energy,it transitions to a positive energy 
state, leaving behind a “hole”.The hole isn’t filled by another electron 
due to the Pauli exclusion principle,which prevents two electrons 
from occupying the same state.This “hole” behaves like a 
positively charged particle,identical in mass but opposite in charge to the 
electron, acting as its antimatter counterpart.So Dirac’s theory not only resolved the negative 
energy puzzle but predicted the existence ofantimatter, based purely on mathematical 
logic rather than empirical evidence.His hypothesis was met with skepticism.Farmelo, in his book, describes 
how: “...the critical chorushad swelled from a whisper to a roar.” 
 
Heisenberg was concerned he might be wrong.So was physicist Wolfgang Pauli.Bohr was among those who were 
skeptical of the hole theory,and he confronted Dirac directly, 
asking, “Do you believe all that stuff?”Dirac simply responded: “‘I don't think anyone 
has put a conclusive argument against it.’”He would be proved right a few years later.In 1932, Carl Anderson at Caltech 
was observing the effects ofcosmic rays within his cloud chamber. 
 
He captured a photo of a charged particle,curving in a manner that 
indicated a positive charge.Anderson had stumbled upon the positron,the antiparticle to the electron, providing the 
empirical evidence to support Dirac’s theory.When asked later why he did not speak 
out more boldly to predict the positron,Dirac said it was because of “pure cowardice”.He was ecstatic about his theory but 
was also afraid of being proved wrong.Anderson’s confirmation of the existence 
of the positron catapulted Dirac to fame.The following year, 1933, he was 
awarded the Nobel Prize in Physicsalongside Schrodinger for their 
contributions to atomic theory.Dirac was initially reluctant to 
accept the Prize as he hated publicity,but when others pointed out he’d receive even 
more publicity for turning it down, he accepted.At 31, he stood atop the scientific world,his contributions defying the 
expectations of his peers.His personal life was also 
poised to defy expectations.He was so quiet and awkward that there was 
never any expectation that he would find love.Dirac once asked Heisenberg why he danced, 
to which Heisenberg replied it was a pleasureto dance with nice girls.
 
Dirac responded: 'Heisenberg,how do you know beforehand that the girls are 
nice?'" as described by Farmelo in his book.Despite his social awkwardness, he managed to 
find a partner who understood his unique mind.In the 1930s, during his sabbatical at the 
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,New Jersey, his colleague, 
physicist Eugene Wigner,introduced him to his sister 
Manci who was visiting.What began as a friendship blossomed into more,despite Dirac’s initial hesitation, 
articulated in this letter to Manci:“You should know that I am not in love 
with you. It would be wrong for me topretend that I am. As I have never been in 
love I cannot understand fine feelings.”This didn’t deter Manci.They later married, and Dirac 
raised Manci’s two children fromher first marriage and together, 
they welcomed two more children.They settled in Cambridge, where Dirac held 
the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics atthe University of Cambridge, one 
of the world's most prestigiousacademic posts for over three decades. 
 
By the late sixties, his scientific workbegan to take a backseat to his home life, 
where he began to focus on his gardening.It was time for a change.Dirac had always enjoyed his visits to America andnow sought to settle there 
with his wife permanently.When he was appointed professor of physics at 
Florida State University, a department then ranked83rd in the U.S., the department head likened it 
to the English faculty recruiting Shakespeare.Despite such high praise, Dirac did 
not view himself in the same light.In a candid conversation with physicist 
Pierre Ramond of the University of Florida,Dirac confided: “My life has been a failure!”That shocked Ramond. 
 
Author Farmelo described it this way:“Ramond would have been less stunned if Dirac had 
smashed him over the head with a baseball bat.”Dirac’s dissatisfaction stemmed from the 
failure of quantum mechanics to explainsomething as simple as the interaction 
between a n electron and photon withoutresorting to infinite values, making 
him view his work as unsatisfactory.Ramond was shattered by Dirac’s assessment, 
remarking: “I could hardly believe that sucha great man could look back on his life as a 
failure. What did that say about the rest of us?”Yet, in the eyes of the world, 
Dirac is far from a failure.In a testament to his enduring legacy, 
Dirac’s equation—a cornerstone of quantummechanics—was immortalized on the 
stone floor of Westminster Abbey.Dirac lived out the rest of his 
years in Tallahassee, Florida.On October 20, 1984, he died of heart 
failure at home with his wife by his side.He was 82 years old.One of the most profound implications of Dirac’s 
work is the asymmetry in matter and antimatter.According to standard physics models, 
the Big Bang should have produced equalamounts of matter and antimatter, meaning 
they would have annihilated each other,leaving a universe filled only with energy.And yet, our universe is dominated by matter, 
which makes possible the formation of stars,galaxies, and everything we 
see, including ourselves.It remains one of the great mysteries in physics.Paul Dirac unlocked the mysteries of the 
universe through his profound understandingof the fundamental principles 
of science and mathematics.If you have a quest for knowledge and would liketo brush up on your STEM skills, I

Video script When you look at this, what do you see?To me,  this is one of the most beautiful, fascinatingand frustrating things i've ever seen.That's because I'm a mathematician,and these hypnotizing curly cues have haunted people like me for 150 years.What we're looking at is a glimpse of the Riemann hypothesis.It's one of the most important  -- if not THE most important -- unsolved problems in all of mathematics.You may have heard about the Riemann hypothesis, because it's one of the millennium problems of the Clay Institute.What that means is that the person who solves it not only achieves immortality in mathematics,but also wins a 1 million prize.But there are other reasons to care about the enigma that is the Riemann hypothesis.If the hypothesis is true, it would solve a mystery as old as math itself:That is, the mystery of the prime numbers.Countless theorems in fields as far apart as 
cryptography and quantum physics assume that  the Riemann hypothesis is true,which means that we have a lot riding on this single, unproven statement.So, what is it? What is the Riemann hypothesis?Why has the search for a proof become something of a holy grail for mathematicians?And what do these strange curly cues have to do with all of this?My name is Alex Kontorovich, and I'm a professor of mathematics.I'll serve as your guide as we explore the Riemann Hypothesis.In order to build a somewhat sophisticated understanding of this hypothesis,what I'm going to try to do is mention some slightly advanced concepts.Now, you don't need an advanced degree 
in mathematics to go on this journey with me.What I'm going to do is try to lay the groundwork, 
step by step, in a visual and intuitive way.So to begin, let's venture into the chaotic 
and elusive universe of prime numbers.This is factor city, where the primes are 
literally the building blocks of all numbers.  Now, every whole number is a building, and it's 
been constructed out of its primes.The one-story houses are exactly the primes.Now thanks to the ancient Greek, Euclid of Alexandria,we know that the one-story buildings keep going on forever-- if you can walk that far.But, depending on where you're standing, you might want to know:How many one story buildings do you see around you?This is what we want to understand about the prime 
numbers, and what we currently don't.You see, the prime numbers seem to just pop up randomly among the natural numbers,all the way out to infinity.In the late 1700s, mathematicians were 
really starting to wonder whether it was  possible to predict the places where primes would 
appear.Now, a teenage boy named Carl Friedrich Gausswas especially obsessed with taming the 
primes.He calculated massive tables of primes,going all the way up to 3 million, and looked for 
patterns.We can see the data that Gauss collected on the prime numbers by using something we'll call the Prime Counting Function.The graph of that function will show us exactly 
where the prime numbers appearas the numbers get bigger and bigger.So, the graph stays flat until you hit a prime, and at that point it jumps up by one.Here's what the graph looks like out to 10-- and out to 100 --and now out to 3 million, as far as Gauss went.At this scale, those bumps we saw early on have smoothed out,leaving a pretty pleasant curve.When Gauss looked at this data, he asked himself:Is there some other function that I know that has pretty much the same graph?Now, as luck would have it, at around the same time Gauss was also playing around with logarithm functions.You might remember that a logarithm is 
a function that undoes exponentiation,  much in the same way as division undoes 
multiplication.What Gauss noticed was that the graph of something called the logarithmic integral function(that's a function whose slope is 1 over log x)looked suspiciously similar to the graph of the Prime Counting Function.Here's what they look like together.You can see why Gauss made the connection.At this scale, they're so close you can't even distinguish 
them.To understand what the slope of one over log x has to do with prime numbers,let's pay another visit to Factor City.What Gauss imagined was that if you're standing at address x,and you look left and you look right,the proportion of one story buildings, that is primes, that 
you would see around youis roughly the same as one over log x.This suspicion became known as Gauss's Conjecture.After Gauss formulated this conjecture,his student Bernard Riemann went on to 
do something absolutely incredible with it.But to understand what Riemann did, we first have to go 
back in time a little bit to meet someone else.This is Leonard Euler one of the world's first 
students of calculus.Later on in his life, he wrote many influential textbooksand standardized the modern math notation that we still use to this day.If you've ever written something in standard 
function notation -- you know, like y equals f x --well you can thank, or perhaps blame, Leonard Euler.In Euler's time, mathematicians were tryingto understand the general structure of infinite 
series.What that means is you're trying to add up an infinite sequence of numbers, like1, a half, a quarter, an eighth, and so on, forever,sometimes that total sum is a finite number, which 
we then call a limit.If a series has a limit we would say that the series itself is convergent.In this series, our limit is 2.On the other hand, if we were to add, let's say, one plus one plus one plus one plus one forever,well that sum would eventually become larger than any finite number,and so we would say that that series is divergent.Sometimes it can be rather tricky to 
tell if a given series converges or not.  So for example, this series, which 
is called the harmonic series,  turns out actually diverges, even though the 
terms themselves are getting smaller and smaller.  This is really rather not obvious, and takes 
some mathematical gymnastics to verify.  Now, what about this series, the sum of 1 over the 
squares of all the positive integers?It wasn't hard for mathematicians to show that this series 
does indeed converge.But the question was, what is the exact limit?Euler shot to mathematical superstardom when he saw this problem.What he realized and proved is that the limit is 
pi squared over six.Isn't that weird? What in the world does pi have to do with the squares?Well, that's another story for another time.So, full of adrenaline from his early victory, 
Euler kept going.He found the limits of the sum of one over the positive integers to the fourth power,and to the sixth power, and to the eighth power.Now, let's try to study all these series at once.Let's write "s" for that exponent.When we do this, we define what's called the Zeta function.In other words, Zeta of two is the sum of one over the squares,and Zeta four is the sum of one over the fourth powers, and so on.Euler proved that all of these converge, but 
only when s is greater than one.But here's where things got really interesting.Euler discovered that the Zeta function could be expressed as an infinite productone -- for each prime number -- of an infinite series.Here's what you do:For each prime number, you add up one over all the powers of that prime to the s.If you multiply all those series over all the prime numbers, you get the Zeta function.  Euler's discovery hinted at an intimate connection between the Zeta function and prime numbers.But it would take another hundred years for the full meaning to reveal itself.And that's when our friend Bernhard Riemann would 
make a major breakthrough in prime number theory.  And that breakthrough would potentially allow us, for the first time,  to understand the profound mysteries of 
prime numbers.So, Riemann.He's born in 1826 in modern-day Germany.He's an absolutely spectacular and innovative prolific mathematician,and, among other things, his novel approach to 
geometryactually lays the mathematical groundwork for Einstein's theory of relativity.Riemann was also one of the founders of complex analysis,which is a branch of math that studies functions 
with complex inputs and outputs.And he realized he might have something new to say if he studied, from that point of view, Euler's Zeta function.You might remember that the square of any 
real number is positive:So 2 squared is 4, but negative 2 squared is also four.So there is no number whose square is negative one.It turns out that it's really rather useful for 
mathematiciansto have a number whose square is negative one. So what did we do?We just made one up.We called it "I" for imaginary,so whenever you see i squared what that means is 
you should replace it with negative 1.This means that any real multiple of i, like 3i or 2i, these 
are all imaginary cousins of the real numbers.When you take combinations of real numbers and 
imaginary numbers, you get something we call a  complex number. Complex numbers might look 
like two numbers, but they're actually just  one number expressed as two parts: The real part 
and the imaginary.The thing is, these imaginary and complex numbers they aren't imaginary at all --they're just the natural extension of our usual number system from one dimension to two.They're plotted in what we call the complex plane, with the real part going left to right,and the imaginary part up to down.Once you have these complex numbers, you can 
study complex functions --that is, functions with inputs and outputs living in the complex plane.And so, armed with the power of complex analysis,Riemann opened up a whole new perspective on 
the world of mathematics.Riemann wondered: What would happen if you allowed the Zeta function to take complex inputs?That is, he allowed s to be a complex number.So let's take the complex exponent s equals two plus 3i, for example.We can plug it into Zetaand the function will look like this.Now, if we add each term, one at a time in the complex plane,we can see how the series begins to spiral beautifully.So Riemann had successfully accomplished what he 
set out to do:He extended the Zeta function to the complex plane.But just like Euler, Riemann found that the function only convergedwhen the real part of s was greater than one.Now Riemann had a brilliant idea:He realized it was possible to extend the Zeta function to the rest of the complex plane.Riemann used a technique called analytic continuation,which allowed him to break open the hidden potential of the Zeta function.Now, analytic continuation is an advanced concept 
in complex analysis,but it's possible to make sense of it intuitively.You can think of it as a logical problem-solving method to extend the domain of a function.In order for Riemann to fill in the missing part of the domain in Euler's data function,he had to create a brand new function.This function would take the same values as the Zeta function, where they both converge,but it had to make sense everywhere else on the plane, too.So the secret to analytic continuation isthat there are really two functions at work at once.One is the original Zeta function, which has 
limited scope.But the other is this new function,the Riemann Zeta function, which extends 
beyond the domain that Euler defined.Remember this?Now we can take a closer look at it and finally begin to understand its mysteries.You see, when Riemann extended the domain of the 
Zeta function,something kind of amazing happened.In the new territory that Riemann uncovered,suddenly the Zeta function can be seen crossing through the origin.What that means is for some inputs, the Zeta function evaluates to zero.We call these places the "Zetas zeros".Some of the Zeta zeros are easy to explain.When you input a negative even integer, the Zeta function 
equals zero.But we don't need to worry about these so-called "trivial zeros"-- it's the non-trivial zeros that we need to talk about.These other Zeta zeros exhibit a very compelling 
pattern,and that pattern is the central theme of the Riemann hypothesis.All of the non-trivial zeros lie inside a single region called the critical strip.This is where the real part of s is between 0 and 1.Riemann proved that there are infinitely many zeros to be found in this critical strip.But here is the most important takeaway from Riemann's groundbreaking 1859 paper:Riemann hypothesized that all of the non-trivial zeros will lie not just somewhere in the strip,but on a single vertical line,smack dab in the middle.We call this the "critical line" which 
is where the real part of s is exactly one half.This is exactly the hypothesis that now bears 
Riemann's name and the million dollar bounty.Now at this point, you might be wondering: 
Why does the location of these non-trivial  zeros matter, and what does all of this have 
to do with prime numbers?I don't blame you.Let me show you exactly why Riemann's hypothesis 
is of such profound consequence to number theory.And let me do so by sharing Riemann's final discovery.Remember Gauss's prime counting function, from the 
very beginning of the video?Well, for technical reasons we're going to slightly modify it right now,but don't worry. We'll preserve the essence of the function.instead of stepping up by 1 every 
time we see a new prime number,which we'll call p, let us step up by log p.And we'll also do the same when we encounter p squared, and p cubed, and p to the fourth, and so on.So let me try to explain why we're doing all of this.Riemann found a surprising connection between 
this modification of Gauss's conjectureand his new Zeta function.He discovered a wave that 
corresponds to the Zeta function at s equals one,and showed that Gauss's conjecture would follow,if only you could show that this wave was the fundamental frequency,which means that it more and more closely approximates the prime counting function as they both grow to infinity.So here's what the prime counting function looks like with that wave that Riemann discovered.Riemann realized that the Zeta zeros were exactly what he needed to adjust this straight lineto match the jagged counting function.Every time he added a Zeta zero, it contributed a harmonic.Here's what the first harmonic looks like when we add it on.It ever so gently tries to smooth out the wiggles of the modified prime counting function.  What happens when we plug in the second Zeta zero?Little better, right?What about the first 10, or the first 30,or the first 60?You get the point.Riemann was able to rigorously prove that if 
you add up all the harmonics of the Zeta zeros,  all infinitely many of them,you get a perfect match to Gauss's modified prime counting function.So, Riemann's hypothesis showed that the 
distribution of prime numbers can in fact  be predicted.The location of prime numbers is profoundly connected to the location of these non-trivial Zeta zeros.This means that if the Riemann hypothesis is indeed true,it would tell us everything we could possibly have a right to know about the distribution of prime numbers.Needless to say, Riemann was unable to prove the full hypothesis.In other words, neither he nor anyone since has been able to show that every single non-trivial Zeta zerolies on that critical line.At one point, a massive computing project checked over one billion non-trivial Zeta zerosevery single day.The computer was looking for a single errant zero.If it found just one, then the Riemann hypothesis would fall apart.In the end, of the 10 trillion zeros that the computer checked,every single one was on the critical line.But if you see a pattern holding again and 
again and again,it's still impossible for machines to check it all the way to infinity.So brute force computation will never resolve the Riemann hypothesis.That means there's still only one way to be sure of it,and it's the same way that the ancient Greeks did 
their math:rigorous absolute mathematical proof.

Video script can we go old school Brady and talkabout a particular number yeah276 276 we'll do a deep dive into someunsolved problems in number theory ifyou're up for it pick a number whatabout like eight eight I'd like you totell me its factors or rathertechnically it's proper factors but allthat means is it's factors or devisersdepending on where you are in the worldnot including itself one two and fourand we're gonna add themup do you want to do that in your headyeah seven hey sothis is a process called the aliquatprocess this quat bit other words likequote and quotient all of which are todo with part of something and actuallyit's the first time I realized thatquote like you do a quote from someoneyou're telling us part of their speechlike and that's where the word quote iscome from but also quotient which is atechnical maass word for dividing thingslike dividing into different parts Ali Ithink Latin alas also Alias somethingother when you rename something to besomething else so this is like the otherparts so the alqua process is taking theproper factor of this number and addingup and you've got a number which islower than we started with but doing analqua sequence means doing it again soyou got seven go again tell me theproper factors and I hope you recognizethis is going to be quite quick yeah Imean that's just got one because we'renot doing seven itself so eight went toseven notice it went lower and sevenwent to one and actually if we carriedon one has no proper factors if we'regoing to Define that is not includingitself so you get zero but we might aswell stop there I'm saying that if youget to one it's kind of got boring atthat point then that's the end of oursequence your number that you choseeight got lower and actually that meanswe call eight a deficient number and Idon't know if that's a word you've comeacross before it certainly turned up onnumber file but whether you remember itlike every number is eitherdeficient or something else and I do youknow what else could happen if you pickhis proper factors and add it up I meanit could could add up to more than thenumber do you know what they call itlike Surplus uh yeah that's a good uhsynonym for the word I'm thinking ofwhich is the word abundant abundantthat's right I do so numbers could bedeficient like or abundant we can tryand pick an abundant number do you wantto try and guess one um the clue isactually a number with lots of factorswell let's try 24 because it is actuallyFour factorial but also like it'sfamously got lots of factors onetwo uh does three go in there it doesyeah three factors are also used touseful to do in pairs so if you've gottwo you could probably tell me 12because two * 12 and 3 * 8 is 24 4 * 6there's the six I was thinking of andI'm pretty sure we've run out andactually factor pairs are quite usefulyou sort of have to head towards themiddle 24 would go with the one butsince we're doing proper factors we'renot going to include it so let's justadd these up 20 3 6 we're found anabundant number Brady well done Eight'sdivision 24 is abundant and actuallylet's do the aliquat sequence becausethis time it's gone higher so if I takewhatever answer I get and do it againlet's go 36 36 has factors 1 2 and 18three goes in and I think that would be12 four goes in and that would be a ninewith it six is a factor as well prettysure those are all the factors can addthese up I mean if this needs fastforwarding ready you know what to do 3039 45 49 52 54 55 also abundant abundantbut I wonder if you can predict what'sgoing to happen now because thissequence I just keep doing it this iswhat an alqua sequence is and you justsee what happens so 55 uh 1 * 55 2 threeno none of those go in pretty sure it's5 * 11 and I think that's it doesn'tfeel like it's going to be abundantanymore 11+ 5 16 17 which is Prime and Ithink you know what happens to primesyou found one earlier it goes to onegame over here so this one took one twothree terms or fourth terms to get toone I'm not really too worried about butit looks like even when you started withan abundant number this thing eventuallyhits deficient and starts tracking backdown to one if it's not abundant ordeficient what else could it be theseare rhetorical questions because theseare called the perfect numbers ah lovelyyeah and so six is one of them if youtake the proper factor six one two andthree you add it to get six and if yousee if you do an alqua sequence on aperfect number it's never going to getto one unlike the other ones we'velooked that they will stick in a loop 28is famously perfect the next one is 496and they turn up and there's all sortsof stories we can tell why we neverfound an odd perfect number I'm notgetting into that as interesting as itis what I like about these alootsequences is they are doing things thatI already knew quite a lot about perfectnumbers abundant deficient but nowthere's another question which is if youkeep doing thisprocess what could happen is there anumber that never goes to one well we'veseen some that do go to one so we knowit can do that we've also talked aboutsome numbers which don't get to onebecause they're perfect what else couldhappen and I think there's some otherfamiliar landmarks we just haven'tspotted yet on the horizon we'd have tobe talking about numbers that when yousum their proper factors go into a loopcouldn't they just keep being abundantabundant abund there's the otherquestion um could you find an alootsequence that doesn't converge so let'sfirst of all establish the the loopthing famously 220 if you add up itsproper factors you get296 and if you add up the factors of 196the proper factors you get to 120 infact let me just get mykeys uh so I tot you want to find my mybunch of keys I don't at me rightthey're too big I know but this is thenumber 220 uh this is called an amicablenumber because it is best friends with296 those two go in a loop and if you dothe Alo quart sequence of either themyou just get the other one and this ishalf of a heart uh it's horribly clichedromantic to say that my wife has theother half of my heart and she has onewith the number 296 onthis is the lowest pair of amicablenumbers that exist okay so there there'sthe there's the loop what about foreverso the question is uh and this is now afamous piece of mathematics called theCatalan Dixon conjecture do all aliquatsequences either end in one or hit aperfect number and loop or amicablenumbers and in fact there are othercycles of what they call sociablenumbers which don't go in an amicablepair but they go in Loops uh and there'sa whole other branch of number theoryabout that but the Catalan Dixon conjectis do they all go into a loop or hitone and this is where you stop doing itby hand because it's easy to check thelow numbers and it becomes tedious tocheck the large numbers so we're goingto bust out some code okay so what I didwas program joj to take the properfactors have them up and then spit itback in and all it's going to do is plota little graph of where it goes so whatwe're expecting to see is abundantnumbers start with the graph going upand anytime you see a tick up in thegraph we've found an abundant number anddivision will go down perfect stay thesame and you're kind of stuck there solet's just do a quick check here is thenumber six I think you know what's goingto happen I've told it to give up afterlike six repeats so if I click go onthis the number six doesn't change it'sa perfect number your number that youstarted with was eight so let's go oneight and we're expecting it to dropstraight down went to seven went to oneand it's gone to zero and stoppedworking let's try the other one you didwhich is 24 and we're expecting thistime to to go up a bit better then itcomes down so now this I love about thissort of number Theory thing this isbasic maths but we've got an infinitenumber of numbers to explore and some ofthem are surprising so if we do do onethat we just talked about 220 there'sthat amicable pair bouncing around let'stry some other ones I'm going to try thenumber 95 because I know what happensand this has got a special name this iscalled an aspiring number uh and Ihadn't heard that term we've got a lotof these familiar sort of friendlynumber words like perfect abundantdeficient amicable sociable aspiring isone I hadn't come across but here's oneof them so here's a number that doesn'tget to one actually got to six and it'sstuck there so 95 is not perfect butit's almost there so it's aspiring to beperfect that's I think why they've namedit it knows the way to perfect it knowsthe way to perfect that's a gooddefinition of an aspiring number ifyou're using an alqua sequence and againI was like why have I I heard this wordand I actually asked a bunch ofrespected math math communicators andmathematicians and some of them haveheard it if they've done the number thethey're like of course I've heard of itand a bunch of us including myself werelike I've not heard this and yet I knowall the other numbers that come out ofthis little study so I enjoy like doingsomething new so 95 is aspiring that wasa new one for me let's try some othernumbers I'm going to try 30 so 30 lookat that I mean I'm sounding excitedbecause actually you try loads ofnumbers and they're deficient mostnumbers are deficient and they justshoot down and end at one 30 goes up forquite a long time it jumps up to thenumber260 and then it's all over and itcollapses down but here you have a firstGlimpse that some numbers go quite highbefore they come backdown 25 what you reckon 25 ends up beingaspiring cuz it goes to six straightaway uh and then it stays there so let'stry a more surprising number uh youdon't have to go very high to hit somesurprises I'm going to try the number138 if you are remembering the number Imentioned at the beginning just holdthat thought because it is connectedwith this uh and I hope that my jojprogramming skills let me get away withthis up and up and up and up oh down ohand up oh it's playing with you oh it'sa yes go son go never stop oh no no nono oh no it's back it's back I mean I'vedeliberately slowed this down to giveyou the chance to commentate so wellit's gone so high now we can't see anyof the blits earlier amazing oh no it'sdownagain it's down my computer is chuggingaway doing the calculations here oh noit doesn't look good but we saw it didit was looking like that before come oncome how long should we watch I mean ifit's still going it hasn't found aperfect number it's just that we can'tsee these numbers they're so smallcompared to the 18 billion that was uphere and at this point it hits one itstopped oh138 hits one but before it gets there ithit almost 18 billion hold on let let mecheck right so thousand million billion180 billionuh you do not want to do thatcalculation by hand what a ride that wasand I I enjoyed your commentary cuz thefirst time I programmed this and thefact that it went slowly enough like ifit was all over quickly you wouldn'thave seen any of those flips and youstill can't see them now right Ben youknow what we should start a YouTubechannel where we just pick a randomnumber where we just pick numbers andthen commentate the sequence let's do itlike marble racing we'll do some b-rollfootage of that in a minute but um theother problem is this is a niceobservation about like you can't see thejourney that fun time we had is vanishedin the in the week down here rightbecause this number is so big that theseare minis School in comparison so thisis a prime candidate for not plottingthis on a linear scale we're going touse a logarithmic scale and I'm justgoing to flip over to the log scale onthe screen and what that will do isinstead of plotting the number it willplot the basically the power of 10 andthat number how many digits that numberhas so I'm going to use log base 10 toplot it and I'm going to flip straightover to that there is the journey wewent on on a logarithmic scale himasyeah and we've got this mountain rangeand all that commentation going on herelike this is 180 billion sologarithmically there's a hugedifference to down here but a log scalehelps you see these things it's a reallynice example of why log scales help yousee detail when there's more than a feworders of magnitude going on but 138 didcollapse eventually so it now feels likea genuine question are there any thatdon't come back and the answeris we don't know of coursenot but there are a few interestingexamples so first of all let's hit theheadline and then we can go exploringthe jungle again if you like um if youdouble138 you get 276 which I may havementioned earlier um I'm going to runthat one on python for reasons if I runit on joji uh the thing melts right jojiis not a good processing thing for doingheavy duty calculations and you canimagine like in this one it had tofactorize a number in the hundreds ofbillions now it can do it but it's notquick and I hope all number of ourviewers are aware that factoring numberstakes a long time when they get big andthat's partly why the internet is stillsecure hooray uh python is better atdoing this stuff so I'm going to runthis on python I don't know if I cantake the excitement of another one likethat okay some badly written pythonscript here I'm actually going to run138 again so we can see how that lookshere it comes right that's it doing thenumber crunching that like we did onpaper that's the aloot sequence itreached an end which means it's going tostart animating it and now you can seethat mountain range we were commentingon is already doing a log scale by theway because I knew it was going to beimpossible to seeand the reason this is working moreefficiently is that it's done allcalculations first and it's just done alittle animation for me so I'm going todo this for 276 and you'll see whyimmediately I needed to do on pythonlet's just see what happens so here comethenumbers they're spitting out the bottomof my screen they're getting big rightit's given up it's got too large fortoday downhere and it gave up after 70 and alreadylike we're up at 70 steps 70 steps andit's gone beyond 10 the^ 13 but it couldcrunch to one in like a step it couldand I've gone a bit further and so haveothersand the reason I'm telling you aboutthis one is that we have not gone farenough to know and we've got thesupercomputers involved this has beenrunning on people's computers for a longtime it's the first number that wegenuinely don't know everything else upto 276 we've checked and it's eithercollapsed one or got in a loop uh andwe'll see some nice examples and we'vedone loads of other numbers too muchhigher and a lot of them all claps toone and go in Loops but this onesurprisingly low if you ask me we justdon't know and we do not have thecomputing power to get to the end of itand it hey The Next Step that someonecalculates you're right it mightcollapse we might hit a deficient streakbut these numbers you could hit aperfect number well you could we don'tmaybe this is an aspiring number likemaybe this one wants to be perfect andwe'll get there eventually but we don'tknow the Catalan Dixon conjecture saysmaybe all of them go to one or hit aperfect Loop but this is a counterexample if it doesn't we just don't knowhow to check if it does CU we haven'tgot the computing power so here's anunsolved problem with matics and what Ilike is this is low hanging fruit it'swithin that territory that a lot of usknow about with with recreational numberTheory perfect abundant deficientnumbers the 276 is the first of whatthey call the Lamer five he was amathematician he found five numbers lessthan a thousand that we don't know aboutare they all still open or they allstill open so there's other numbers lessthan a thousand that also we don't knowabout but they tap into the samesequence so for example if you try 306it does some stuff and then it slotsinto the same numbers that 276 does soyou end up with exactly the same graphin the same shape so they feel like lessunique but there are a few of them butthere are five with unique patterns thatare not coming down as far as we'vechecked under five and they are 276 552564 660 and966 and we just don't know do you wantto see what some other numbers do thatwe do know about yeah right let's let'sexplore the jungle a bit because thereare literally infinitely many numbers toexplore and the ones we have come acrosssome of them are nice all right first upfor your consideration I'm going to do98 0460 go go gadget aliquat sequence thenumbers will spit out first well onedivides 220 2 four five uh 10 what Ilike about this is that they missed apair in fact they missed the secondsmallest pair of amicable numbers andthese were found 200 years later it'snever going to hit five what we don'tknow well at the moment five is the onlyUntouchable number we found which is oddall of the others are even so unsolvedconjecture number two of this video isfive the only odd Untouchable number

Video script When you look at this, what do you see?To me,  this is one of the most beautiful, fascinatingand frustrating things i've ever seen.That's because I'm a mathematician,and these hypnotizing curly cues have haunted people like me for 150 years.What we're looking at is a glimpse of the Riemann hypothesis.It's one of the most important  -- if not THE most important -- unsolved problems in all of mathematics.You may have heard about the Riemann hypothesis, because it's one of the millennium problems of the Clay Institute.What that means is that the person who solves it not only achieves immortality in mathematics,but also wins a 1 million prize.But there are other reasons to care about the enigma that is the Riemann hypothesis.If the hypothesis is true, it would solve a mystery as old as math itself:That is, the mystery of the prime numbers.Countless theorems in fields as far apart as 
cryptography and quantum physics assume that  the Riemann hypothesis is true,which means that we have a lot riding on this single, unproven statement.So, what is it? What is the Riemann hypothesis?Why has the search for a proof become something of a holy grail for mathematicians?And what do these strange curly cues have to do with all of this?My name is Alex Kontorovich, and I'm a professor of mathematics.I'll serve as your guide as we explore the Riemann Hypothesis.In order to build a somewhat sophisticated understanding of this hypothesis,what I'm going to try to do is mention some slightly advanced concepts.Now, you don't need an advanced degree 
in mathematics to go on this journey with me.What I'm going to do is try to lay the groundwork, 
step by step, in a visual and intuitive way.So to begin, let's venture into the chaotic 
and elusive universe of prime numbers.This is factor city, where the primes are 
literally the building blocks of all numbers.  Now, every whole number is a building, and it's 
been constructed out of its primes.The one-story houses are exactly the primes.Now thanks to the ancient Greek, Euclid of Alexandria,we know that the one-story buildings keep going on forever-- if you can walk that far.But, depending on where you're standing, you might want to know:How many one story buildings do you see around you?This is what we want to understand about the prime 
numbers, and what we currently don't.You see, the prime numbers seem to just pop up randomly among the natural numbers,all the way out to infinity.In the late 1700s, mathematicians were 
really starting to wonder whether it was  possible to predict the places where primes would 
appear.Now, a teenage boy named Carl Friedrich Gausswas especially obsessed with taming the 
primes.He calculated massive tables of primes,going all the way up to 3 million, and looked for 
patterns.We can see the data that Gauss collected on the prime numbers by using something we'll call the Prime Counting Function.The graph of that function will show us exactly 
where the prime numbers appearas the numbers get bigger and bigger.So, the graph stays flat until you hit a prime, and at that point it jumps up by one.Here's what the graph looks like out to 10-- and out to 100 --and now out to 3 million, as far as Gauss went.At this scale, those bumps we saw early on have smoothed out,leaving a pretty pleasant curve.When Gauss looked at this data, he asked himself:Is there some other function that I know that has pretty much the same graph?Now, as luck would have it, at around the same time Gauss was also playing around with logarithm functions.You might remember that a logarithm is 
a function that undoes exponentiation,  much in the same way as division undoes 
multiplication.What Gauss noticed was that the graph of something called the logarithmic integral function(that's a function whose slope is 1 over log x)looked suspiciously similar to the graph of the Prime Counting Function.Here's what they look like together.You can see why Gauss made the connection.At this scale, they're so close you can't even distinguish 
them.To understand what the slope of one over log x has to do with prime numbers,let's pay another visit to Factor City.What Gauss imagined was that if you're standing at address x,and you look left and you look right,the proportion of one story buildings, that is primes, that 
you would see around youis roughly the same as one over log x.This suspicion became known as Gauss's Conjecture.After Gauss formulated this conjecture,his student Bernard Riemann went on to 
do something absolutely incredible with it.But to understand what Riemann did, we first have to go 
back in time a little bit to meet someone else.This is Leonard Euler one of the world's first 
students of calculus.Later on in his life, he wrote many influential textbooksand standardized the modern math notation that we still use to this day.If you've ever written something in standard 
function notation -- you know, like y equals f x --well you can thank, or perhaps blame, Leonard Euler.In Euler's time, mathematicians were tryingto understand the general structure of infinite 
series.What that means is you're trying to add up an infinite sequence of numbers, like1, a half, a quarter, an eighth, and so on, forever,sometimes that total sum is a finite number, which 
we then call a limit.If a series has a limit we would say that the series itself is convergent.In this series, our limit is 2.On the other hand, if we were to add, let's say, one plus one plus one plus one plus one forever,well that sum would eventually become larger than any finite number,and so we would say that that series is divergent.Sometimes it can be rather tricky to 
tell if a given series converges or not.  So for example, this series, which 
is called the harmonic series,  turns out actually diverges, even though the 
terms themselves are getting smaller and smaller.  This is really rather not obvious, and takes 
some mathematical gymnastics to verify.  Now, what about this series, the sum of 1 over the 
squares of all the positive integers?It wasn't hard for mathematicians to show that this series 
does indeed converge.But the question was, what is the exact limit?Euler shot to mathematical superstardom when he saw this problem.What he realized and proved is that the limit is 
pi squared over six.Isn't that weird? What in the world does pi have to do with the squares?Well, that's another story for another time.So, full of adrenaline from his early victory, 
Euler kept going.He found the limits of the sum of one over the positive integers to the fourth power,and to the sixth power, and to the eighth power.Now, let's try to study all these series at once.Let's write "s" for that exponent.When we do this, we define what's called the Zeta function.In other words, Zeta of two is the sum of one over the squares,and Zeta four is the sum of one over the fourth powers, and so on.Euler proved that all of these converge, but 
only when s is greater than one.But here's where things got really interesting.Euler discovered that the Zeta function could be expressed as an infinite productone -- for each prime number -- of an infinite series.Here's what you do:For each prime number, you add up one over all the powers of that prime to the s.If you multiply all those series over all the prime numbers, you get the Zeta function.  Euler's discovery hinted at an intimate connection between the Zeta function and prime numbers.But it would take another hundred years for the full meaning to reveal itself.And that's when our friend Bernhard Riemann would 
make a major breakthrough in prime number theory.  And that breakthrough would potentially allow us, for the first time,  to understand the profound mysteries of 
prime numbers.So, Riemann.He's born in 1826 in modern-day Germany.He's an absolutely spectacular and innovative prolific mathematician,and, among other things, his novel approach to 
geometryactually lays the mathematical groundwork for Einstein's theory of relativity.Riemann was also one of the founders of complex analysis,which is a branch of math that studies functions 
with complex inputs and outputs.And he realized he might have something new to say if he studied, from that point of view, Euler's Zeta function.You might remember that the square of any 
real number is positive:So 2 squared is 4, but negative 2 squared is also four.So there is no number whose square is negative one.It turns out that it's really rather useful for 
mathematiciansto have a number whose square is negative one. So what did we do?We just made one up.We called it "I" for imaginary,so whenever you see i squared what that means is 
you should replace it with negative 1.This means that any real multiple of i, like 3i or 2i, these 
are all imaginary cousins of the real numbers.When you take combinations of real numbers and 
imaginary numbers, you get something we call a  complex number. Complex numbers might look 
like two numbers, but they're actually just  one number expressed as two parts: The real part 
and the imaginary.The thing is, these imaginary and complex numbers they aren't imaginary at all --they're just the natural extension of our usual number system from one dimension to two.They're plotted in what we call the complex plane, with the real part going left to right,and the imaginary part up to down.Once you have these complex numbers, you can 
study complex functions --that is, functions with inputs and outputs living in the complex plane.And so, armed with the power of complex analysis,Riemann opened up a whole new perspective on 
the world of mathematics.Riemann wondered: What would happen if you allowed the Zeta function to take complex inputs?That is, he allowed s to be a complex number.So let's take the complex exponent s equals two plus 3i, for example.We can plug it into Zetaand the function will look like this.Now, if we add each term, one at a time in the complex plane,we can see how the series begins to spiral beautifully.So Riemann had successfully accomplished what he 
set out to do:He extended the Zeta function to the complex plane.But just like Euler, Riemann found that the function only convergedwhen the real part of s was greater than one.Now Riemann had a brilliant idea:He realized it was possible to extend the Zeta function to the rest of the complex plane.Riemann used a technique called analytic continuation,which allowed him to break open the hidden potential of the Zeta function.Now, analytic continuation is an advanced concept 
in complex analysis,but it's possible to make sense of it intuitively.You can think of it as a logical problem-solving method to extend the domain of a function.In order for Riemann to fill in the missing part of the domain in Euler's data function,he had to create a brand new function.This function would take the same values as the Zeta function, where they both converge,but it had to make sense everywhere else on the plane, too.So the secret to analytic continuation isthat there are really two functions at work at once.One is the original Zeta function, which has 
limited scope.But the other is this new function,the Riemann Zeta function, which extends 
beyond the domain that Euler defined.Remember this?Now we can take a closer look at it and finally begin to understand its mysteries.You see, when Riemann extended the domain of the 
Zeta function,something kind of amazing happened.In the new territory that Riemann uncovered,suddenly the Zeta function can be seen crossing through the origin.What that means is for some inputs, the Zeta function evaluates to zero.We call these places the "Zetas zeros".Some of the Zeta zeros are easy to explain.When you input a negative even integer, the Zeta function 
equals zero.But we don't need to worry about these so-called "trivial zeros"-- it's the non-trivial zeros that we need to talk about.These other Zeta zeros exhibit a very compelling 
pattern,and that pattern is the central theme of the Riemann hypothesis.All of the non-trivial zeros lie inside a single region called the critical strip.This is where the real part of s is between 0 and 1.Riemann proved that there are infinitely many zeros to be found in this critical strip.But here is the most important takeaway from Riemann's groundbreaking 1859 paper:Riemann hypothesized that all of the non-trivial zeros will lie not just somewhere in the strip,but on a single vertical line,smack dab in the middle.We call this the "critical line" which 
is where the real part of s is exactly one half.This is exactly the hypothesis that now bears 
Riemann's name and the million dollar bounty.Now at this point, you might be wondering: 
Why does the location of these non-trivial  zeros matter, and what does all of this have 
to do with prime numbers?I don't blame you.Let me show you exactly why Riemann's hypothesis 
is of such profound consequence to number theory.And let me do so by sharing Riemann's final discovery.Remember Gauss's prime counting function, from the 
very beginning of the video?Well, for technical reasons we're going to slightly modify it right now,but don't worry. We'll preserve the essence of the function.instead of stepping up by 1 every 
time we see a new prime number,which we'll call p, let us step up by log p.And we'll also do the same when we encounter p squared, and p cubed, and p to the fourth, and so on.So let me try to explain why we're doing all of this.Riemann found a surprising connection between 
this modification of Gauss's conjectureand his new Zeta function.He discovered a wave that 
corresponds to the Zeta function at s equals one,and showed that Gauss's conjecture would follow,if only you could show that this wave was the fundamental frequency,which means that it more and more closely approximates the prime counting function as they both grow to infinity.So here's what the prime counting function looks like with that wave that Riemann discovered.Riemann realized that the Zeta zeros were exactly what he needed to adjust this straight lineto match the jagged counting function.Every time he added a Zeta zero, it contributed a harmonic.Here's what the first harmonic looks like when we add it on.It ever so gently tries to smooth out the wiggles of the modified prime counting function.  What happens when we plug in the second Zeta zero?Little better, right?What about the first 10, or the first 30,or the first 60?You get the point.Riemann was able to rigorously prove that if 
you add up all the harmonics of the Zeta zeros,  all infinitely many of them,you get a perfect match to Gauss's modified prime counting function.So, Riemann's hypothesis showed that the 
distribution of prime numbers can in fact  be predicted.The location of prime numbers is profoundly connected to the location of these non-trivial Zeta zeros.This means that if the Riemann hypothesis is indeed true,it would tell us everything we could possibly have a right to know about the distribution of prime numbers.Needless to say, Riemann was unable to prove the full hypothesis.In other words, neither he nor anyone since has been able to show that every single non-trivial Zeta zerolies on that critical line.At one point, a massive computing project checked over one billion non-trivial Zeta zerosevery single day.The computer was looking for a single errant zero.If it found just one, then the Riemann hypothesis would fall apart.In the end, of the 10 trillion zeros that the computer checked,every single one was on the critical line.But if you see a pattern holding again and 
again and again,it's still impossible for machines to check it all the way to infinity.So brute force computation will never resolve the Riemann hypothesis.That means there's still only one way to be sure of it,and it's the same way that the ancient Greeks did 
their math:rigorous absolute mathematical proof.

Video script [Prof Frenkel] Can I ask you a question Brady?[Prof Frenkel] What is the most difficult way to earn a million dollars?[Brady] Making Youtube videos.
[Prof Frenkel] *laughs*[Prof Frenkel] Well, you probably know much more about that than I do.[Prof Frenkel] One of the most difficult ones is to solve one of the Millenium Problems in Mathematics,which were set by the Clay Mathematical Institute in the year 2000.One of these problems is called "The Riemann Hypothesis".It refers to a work of a german mathematician, Bernard Riemann,which he did in the year 1859.This is just one of the problems.
In fact, there are seven.And one of them has been solved so far.And interestingly enough, the person who solved the problem has declined the one million dollars.So...It just shows that mathematicians work on these problems, not because they want to make some money.I think it is now the most famous problem in mathematics.It took the place of Fermat's Last Theorem,which was solved by Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor in the mid-1990s.[Brady] But that wasn't a Millenium Problem.
[Prof Frenkel] That was not a Millenium Problem.[Prof Frenkel] The most essential thing here is what we call the Riemann Zeta function.And the Riemann Zeta function is a function, so ...A function is a rule which assigns to every value some other number.And the Riemann Zeta function assigns a certain number to any value of s,and that number is given by the following series:1 divided by 1 to the power of s,plus 1 divided by 2 to the power of s,plus 1 divided by 3 to the power of s,4 to the s, and so on.So, for example, if we set x = 2.Zeta(2) is going to be 1 divided by 1 squared plus1 divided by 2 squared,plus 1 divided by 3 squared,plus 1 divided by 4 squared,and so on.So, what is this?This is one.This is 1 over 4.This is 1 over 9.1 over 16...So this is an example of what mathematicians call a convergent series,which means that, if you sum up the first n terms,you will get an answer
which will get closer and closer to some number.And that number to which it approximates
is called the limit.But the limit here is actually very interesting.And it has been a famous problem in mathematics to find that limit.It is called the Basel problem,named after the city of Basel in Switzerland.And this Basel problem was solved by a great mathematician: Leonhard Euler.And the answer is very surprising.What Euler showed is that this sums up to pi squared over 6.So you may be wondering.What does this sum has to do with a circle?Why would pi squared show up?But Euler came up with a beautiful proof.I'm not going to explain it now, but it's something that you can easily find online.This series is just one example of this Riemann Zeta function,but you can try to do the same for any other value of s.So, for example, if you take s=3, you will get the reciprocals of all the cubes,and you sum them up, and so on.So this will, again, be a convergent series, and you can wonder what that answer is.That would be zeta(3).You can also try to substitute negative numbers.And this is very interesting, because if you substitute... if you just substitute —If s = -1, then what are we going to get?So you will get 1 divided by...1 to the 1 to the -1,plus 1 to the 2 to the -1,plus 1 over 3 to the -1...If you take the reciprocal of something,
which is the inverse of something,then you will get that thing.So this will be 1,this will be 2,this will be 3,this will be 4...[Prof Frenkel] Does it look familiar?
[Brady] Yes, I have seen that before.[Prof Frenkel] We have arrived at the famous sum of all natural numbers:1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ...But, you see, now we obtained in the context of the zeta function.So this is what we call a divergent series.There is no obvious way how we could possibly assign a finite value to it.This sum is infinite, it does not converge to any finite value.But, this context...If we put this value, this infinite sum, in the context of this function,there is actually a way to assign a value to s=-1.And this is what Riemann explained in his paper.And so what Riemann said is that, actually, we should allow s to be, not just a natural number— for example, 2, or 3, or 4, when the series is convergent —but we should allow also all possible real numbers.And not only real numbers, but also complex numbers.The way you get complex numbers is by realizing that, within real numbers,you cannot find the square root of -1.Then what to do?One way is to ban the square root of -1 and say,"This doesn't exist, we cannot use it"But, in mathematics, we have understood, a long time ago, that actually there is a much better way to treat this.the square root of -1.We can simply adjoin it to the real numbers.Think of real numbers as points on a line.Here is 0,and here is 1,and here is 2,and then you can mark your favorite fractions.For example, one half is exactly in the middle way between 0 and 1.And say,1 1/3 would be a third of the way between 1 and 2.But then, you also have things like square root of 2...For example, somewhere here.And then, there is pi, which is just to the right of 3.So all the real numbers live here.Square root of -1 cannot be found anywhere on this line.But we don't give up. We say, "You know what?""Let's actually draw a plane, let's draw another coordinate system""And let's mark square root of -1 on this new coordinate axis."You see, if we do that, then every point on this plane becomes a number.So that would be 2 times square root of -1,3 times the square root of -1, ...But more than that, let me find a number
which is on the intersection of this line.I can draw a vertical line which goes from 2and I can go... can also draw a horizontal line.Then there's this point of intersection.So this point also would represent a number,which would be 2 plus 3 times square root of -1.So, in other words, a general number is going to have what we call a real part,that is the projection onto this axis;and the imaginary part, that's the projection on the vertical one.The notation is a little bit clumsy.Instead of square root of -1, they write i.So then for example: instead of writing 2 + 3 square root of -1, we'll just write 2 plus 3i.It's an imaginary number, we imagine it.
We cannot find it on this real line.So we have imagined it, and then we have adjoined it in our imagination.Real numbers comprise all points on the real line,
on this axis;and complex numbers comprise all the points
on this brown paper,if you could extend the brown paper all the way
to infinity.Right?So let's go back to Riemann.What Riemann's insight was is he said "look, let's think of this argument of the Zeta function, this number s...Initially, we thought that s could be 2, 3, 4, and so on.But then we realised that actually any real number to the right of number 1...not including number 1, because actually in this case you cannot assign a value, it's a divergent series,so it goes to infinity.But anything to the right, and then drawing and marking it with red...For all of them, this function is actually well defined.So... But then he said '"We can actually do more... We can think of s as being a complex number."So instead of thinking of s as just being a point on this line, we can take s anywhere.It will be convergent if it is to the right of this line.So you see if this is the line, which sort of to the right of this line... live all the complex numberswhose real part is greater than 1.So, it turns out — and it's very easy to show — that anywhere in the shaded area, except for this line —so to the right of this line.Now, for any value of s in this area, this function converges to something.—So if I put 6 + 9i into the Riemann Zeta function,
I'll get a convergent series...?—That's right. You get a convergent series.
It will converge to something,which is not going to be a real number.It's goint to be a complex number, because you're
going to add up infinitely many complex numbers.But there will be a certain number to which — which will be a closer and closer approximatedas you go along summing up the series.—So far, basically everything to the right of this line...
—Gives us a bona fide value—will come out to play.
—will come out to play, and will give us a bona fide value.—Can the imaginary part go in negative?Yeh, but the imaginary part... yes. The imaginary part is okay — can be negative or positive.But the real part has to be greater than 1.But, now, you are in the context of a theory of...
functions with complex arguments.And it is what we call a holomorphic function.So it has some very special, very nice properties.So one of the properties that this kind of — what we call holomorphic — functions enjoy is what we callanalytic continuation. So we can extend the definition, i.e. the domain of definition of the function.There are methods which allow — which enable us —
to kind of push the boundary,and kind of... go and expand the domain
in which the function is defined.And in his seminal paper, Riemann did precisely that.He explained how to extend this function
to all possible values, except for one.So there's only one value
where there is nothing you can do;and somehow it will be undefined.And this is what we call a 'pole' or a 'singularity'.And what is that value? That value is actually s = 1.So this is somehow... this is a bad point in some sense.This is a point where we cannot extend....— And i and 0 are components? There's no imaginary components.—That's right. So this is a point which is actually a real number.So it's funny, because you would think that 1 is in some sense easier and better than i.But, at i, this function will be perfectly well defined.But at 1 it will not be well defined; it will have a singularity.But, luckily, it's the only singularity.So, what it means in particular, is that there is a way to assign a value to -1In other words, there is a value Zeta of -1,where by Zeta we now mean this extended function.A function analytically continued to the whole complex plane.And that value will be — you guessed it — -1/12.—Okay.—It is in this sense that people say that you could regularize the sum 1+2+3+4...,and assign to it the value -1/12. Because it shows up as the value of the zeta function where, naively,you are supposed to get 1+2+3+4...But, now, you are getting this value
by a much more sophisticated procedure.By starting with a function of a complex argument,
and extending it beyond the initial domain of definition.—So no matter what number I pluck from here or here, or here, or here or here, and feed it into the function,I'll get a number of some sort...—You will get a well-defined number — uniquely defined number.And you can calculate it on a computer, because this number can be represented by some integral for example.There is a explicit formula for it. Okay? So... and...you will calculate, I will calculate — will get the same result. There is no ambiguity.The only point where it's not well defined is the point s=1.—This is like the Achilles' heel or the weak...
—It's an Achilles' heel — that's a very good way to put it.It's an Achilles' heel of that function.But it's very important; it's responsible for a lot of things that's happening to it.So it's a very important point.So Riemann's hypothesis is the following:it's about the zeros of the zeta function.In other words, it's a question about — for what values — for which s we have zeta(s) = 0.That is the one million dollar question.For which value of s do we have — does this function equal 0.And so... Riemann...Here there is one point that one has to make, which is thatthere are some sort of obvious zeros.So it just so happens that the value at -2, for example, is equal to 0.-4 is equal to 0.So, in other words, all the even negative numbers,
for some reason — it just so happens —and you can see it for example from the function equation easily —that the value is going to be 0.So there's some obvious zeros so to speak, which we already know.The question is what else — where else are the zeros — where are there other zeros...?And it's actually very easy to see... that all other zeros have to be concentrated in this one strip.So, on one side of this strip is the vertical line — is the vertical axis.And on the other side of this strip is this line, when real part is 1.And so, let's... So this is called the critical strip.These are all the complex numbers for which the real part is between 0 and 1.And so, inside this critical strip, there's a middle line, for which the real value is 1/2.And we look at all the numbers for which this is a real part.For example, half plus five i will be a point somewhere here..., so it will be on this line.And what Riemann suggested —the number of zeros is the minimum possible;they all concentrate along this critical line.According to Riemann's hypothesis, which still hasn't been proved.His hypothesis is that all the zeros to his function lie on that line, except for these ones.—Exactly.—All the zeros lie on that line.—On that vertical line, which goes through the point 1/2.That is exactly the statement of Riemann's hypothesis.—So one way to disprove the hypothesis would be to find a zero somewhere in that blue shaded area.—Exactly. We know that all of them are going to be in the blue shaded area.The question is whether they are on this one specific lineAnd believe me, a lot of people have been looking for a counter example.By the way, one wins a million dollars if one proves the Riemann's hypothesis, or disproves it.So if somebody could find a point in here — which is a 0 but is not on this line — will also win one million dollars.So, a lot of people have been searching, but haven't been able to find.—Have a lot of zeros been found on the line?
—Yes, a huge number.I don't remember, but I think trillions of numbers.So all the zeros that have been found are on this line.And there's constantly a search going on for more and more.The way I explained it, it sounds like an esoteric problem.But actually, in this case, there is more to this, that meets the eye.Because Riemann in that amazing paper that he wrote in 1859, he also explained that this behaviourof his zeta function, which is now called after him — Riemann Zeta function —and more specifically, the behaviour and location of the zeros of that function,has a direct bearing on the distribution of prime numbers.And prime numbers are incredibly important.So prime numbers are, you know, something that people have been studying for millennia, right?So Riemann was able to connect the properties of this function to the distribution of prime numbers.And he obtained a beautiful formula, which tells you  how many prime numbers there are,say between 1 and 100, between 1 and 1000, 1 and 1 million,... any n — between 1 and n —using his Zeta function.Which is absolutely astonishing because if you think about the Zeta function...something has to do with complex numbers, and with analytic continuation, and so on so forth...So it's a particular branch of mathematics which is called complex analysis.But prime numbers live in a different branch of mathematics; in number theory.And it is a big surprise that actually the two things are very closely connected.But this relation, that Riemann found, is predicated on the Riemann' hypothesis.It's predicated on knowing all the zeros are located on this critical line.That's why this Riemann hypothesis is so important.Because it is only if we know that Riemann's hypothesis holds that we can obtain all those deep results aboutthe distribution of prime numbers.

Video script can we go old school Brady and talkabout a particular number yeah276 276 we'll do a deep dive into someunsolved problems in number theory ifyou're up for it pick a number whatabout like eight eight I'd like you totell me its factors or rathertechnically it's proper factors but allthat means is it's factors or devisersdepending on where you are in the worldnot including itself one two and fourand we're gonna add themup do you want to do that in your headyeah seven hey sothis is a process called the aliquatprocess this quat bit other words likequote and quotient all of which are todo with part of something and actuallyit's the first time I realized thatquote like you do a quote from someoneyou're telling us part of their speechlike and that's where the word quote iscome from but also quotient which is atechnical maass word for dividing thingslike dividing into different parts Ali Ithink Latin alas also Alias somethingother when you rename something to besomething else so this is like the otherparts so the alqua process is taking theproper factor of this number and addingup and you've got a number which islower than we started with but doing analqua sequence means doing it again soyou got seven go again tell me theproper factors and I hope you recognizethis is going to be quite quick yeah Imean that's just got one because we'renot doing seven itself so eight went toseven notice it went lower and sevenwent to one and actually if we carriedon one has no proper factors if we'regoing to Define that is not includingitself so you get zero but we might aswell stop there I'm saying that if youget to one it's kind of got boring atthat point then that's the end of oursequence your number that you choseeight got lower and actually that meanswe call eight a deficient number and Idon't know if that's a word you've comeacross before it certainly turned up onnumber file but whether you remember itlike every number is eitherdeficient or something else and I do youknow what else could happen if you pickhis proper factors and add it up I meanit could could add up to more than thenumber do you know what they call itlike Surplus uh yeah that's a good uhsynonym for the word I'm thinking ofwhich is the word abundant abundantthat's right I do so numbers could bedeficient like or abundant we can tryand pick an abundant number do you wantto try and guess one um the clue isactually a number with lots of factorswell let's try 24 because it is actuallyFour factorial but also like it'sfamously got lots of factors onetwo uh does three go in there it doesyeah three factors are also used touseful to do in pairs so if you've gottwo you could probably tell me 12because two * 12 and 3 * 8 is 24 4 * 6there's the six I was thinking of andI'm pretty sure we've run out andactually factor pairs are quite usefulyou sort of have to head towards themiddle 24 would go with the one butsince we're doing proper factors we'renot going to include it so let's justadd these up 20 3 6 we're found anabundant number Brady well done Eight'sdivision 24 is abundant and actuallylet's do the aliquat sequence becausethis time it's gone higher so if I takewhatever answer I get and do it againlet's go 36 36 has factors 1 2 and 18three goes in and I think that would be12 four goes in and that would be a ninewith it six is a factor as well prettysure those are all the factors can addthese up I mean if this needs fastforwarding ready you know what to do 3039 45 49 52 54 55 also abundant abundantbut I wonder if you can predict what'sgoing to happen now because thissequence I just keep doing it this iswhat an alqua sequence is and you justsee what happens so 55 uh 1 * 55 2 threeno none of those go in pretty sure it's5 * 11 and I think that's it doesn'tfeel like it's going to be abundantanymore 11+ 5 16 17 which is Prime and Ithink you know what happens to primesyou found one earlier it goes to onegame over here so this one took one twothree terms or fourth terms to get toone I'm not really too worried about butit looks like even when you started withan abundant number this thing eventuallyhits deficient and starts tracking backdown to one if it's not abundant ordeficient what else could it be theseare rhetorical questions because theseare called the perfect numbers ah lovelyyeah and so six is one of them if youtake the proper factor six one two andthree you add it to get six and if yousee if you do an alqua sequence on aperfect number it's never going to getto one unlike the other ones we'velooked that they will stick in a loop 28is famously perfect the next one is 496and they turn up and there's all sortsof stories we can tell why we neverfound an odd perfect number I'm notgetting into that as interesting as itis what I like about these alootsequences is they are doing things thatI already knew quite a lot about perfectnumbers abundant deficient but nowthere's another question which is if youkeep doing thisprocess what could happen is there anumber that never goes to one well we'veseen some that do go to one so we knowit can do that we've also talked aboutsome numbers which don't get to onebecause they're perfect what else couldhappen and I think there's some otherfamiliar landmarks we just haven'tspotted yet on the horizon we'd have tobe talking about numbers that when yousum their proper factors go into a loopcouldn't they just keep being abundantabundant abund there's the otherquestion um could you find an alootsequence that doesn't converge so let'sfirst of all establish the the loopthing famously 220 if you add up itsproper factors you get296 and if you add up the factors of 196the proper factors you get to 120 infact let me just get mykeys uh so I tot you want to find my mybunch of keys I don't at me rightthey're too big I know but this is thenumber 220 uh this is called an amicablenumber because it is best friends with296 those two go in a loop and if you dothe Alo quart sequence of either themyou just get the other one and this ishalf of a heart uh it's horribly clichedromantic to say that my wife has theother half of my heart and she has onewith the number 296 onthis is the lowest pair of amicablenumbers that exist okay so there there'sthe there's the loop what about foreverso the question is uh and this is now afamous piece of mathematics called theCatalan Dixon conjecture do all aliquatsequences either end in one or hit aperfect number and loop or amicablenumbers and in fact there are othercycles of what they call sociablenumbers which don't go in an amicablepair but they go in Loops uh and there'sa whole other branch of number theoryabout that but the Catalan Dixon conjectis do they all go into a loop or hitone and this is where you stop doing itby hand because it's easy to check thelow numbers and it becomes tedious tocheck the large numbers so we're goingto bust out some code okay so what I didwas program joj to take the properfactors have them up and then spit itback in and all it's going to do is plota little graph of where it goes so whatwe're expecting to see is abundantnumbers start with the graph going upand anytime you see a tick up in thegraph we've found an abundant number anddivision will go down perfect stay thesame and you're kind of stuck there solet's just do a quick check here is thenumber six I think you know what's goingto happen I've told it to give up afterlike six repeats so if I click go onthis the number six doesn't change it'sa perfect number your number that youstarted with was eight so let's go oneight and we're expecting it to dropstraight down went to seven went to oneand it's gone to zero and stoppedworking let's try the other one you didwhich is 24 and we're expecting thistime to to go up a bit better then itcomes down so now this I love about thissort of number Theory thing this isbasic maths but we've got an infinitenumber of numbers to explore and some ofthem are surprising so if we do do onethat we just talked about 220 there'sthat amicable pair bouncing around let'stry some other ones I'm going to try thenumber 95 because I know what happensand this has got a special name this iscalled an aspiring number uh and Ihadn't heard that term we've got a lotof these familiar sort of friendlynumber words like perfect abundantdeficient amicable sociable aspiring isone I hadn't come across but here's oneof them so here's a number that doesn'tget to one actually got to six and it'sstuck there so 95 is not perfect butit's almost there so it's aspiring to beperfect that's I think why they've namedit it knows the way to perfect it knowsthe way to perfect that's a gooddefinition of an aspiring number ifyou're using an alqua sequence and againI was like why have I I heard this wordand I actually asked a bunch ofrespected math math communicators andmathematicians and some of them haveheard it if they've done the number thethey're like of course I've heard of itand a bunch of us including myself werelike I've not heard this and yet I knowall the other numbers that come out ofthis little study so I enjoy like doingsomething new so 95 is aspiring that wasa new one for me let's try some othernumbers I'm going to try 30 so 30 lookat that I mean I'm sounding excitedbecause actually you try loads ofnumbers and they're deficient mostnumbers are deficient and they justshoot down and end at one 30 goes up forquite a long time it jumps up to thenumber260 and then it's all over and itcollapses down but here you have a firstGlimpse that some numbers go quite highbefore they come backdown 25 what you reckon 25 ends up beingaspiring cuz it goes to six straightaway uh and then it stays there so let'stry a more surprising number uh youdon't have to go very high to hit somesurprises I'm going to try the number138 if you are remembering the number Imentioned at the beginning just holdthat thought because it is connectedwith this uh and I hope that my jojprogramming skills let me get away withthis up and up and up and up oh down ohand up oh it's playing with you oh it'sa yes go son go never stop oh no no nono oh no it's back it's back I mean I'vedeliberately slowed this down to giveyou the chance to commentate so wellit's gone so high now we can't see anyof the blits earlier amazing oh no it'sdownagain it's down my computer is chuggingaway doing the calculations here oh noit doesn't look good but we saw it didit was looking like that before come oncome how long should we watch I mean ifit's still going it hasn't found aperfect number it's just that we can'tsee these numbers they're so smallcompared to the 18 billion that was uphere and at this point it hits one itstopped oh138 hits one but before it gets there ithit almost 18 billion hold on let let mecheck right so thousand million billion180 billionuh you do not want to do thatcalculation by hand what a ride that wasand I I enjoyed your commentary cuz thefirst time I programmed this and thefact that it went slowly enough like ifit was all over quickly you wouldn'thave seen any of those flips and youstill can't see them now right Ben youknow what we should start a YouTubechannel where we just pick a randomnumber where we just pick numbers andthen commentate the sequence let's do itlike marble racing we'll do some b-rollfootage of that in a minute but um theother problem is this is a niceobservation about like you can't see thejourney that fun time we had is vanishedin the in the week down here rightbecause this number is so big that theseare minis School in comparison so thisis a prime candidate for not plottingthis on a linear scale we're going touse a logarithmic scale and I'm justgoing to flip over to the log scale onthe screen and what that will do isinstead of plotting the number it willplot the basically the power of 10 andthat number how many digits that numberhas so I'm going to use log base 10 toplot it and I'm going to flip straightover to that there is the journey wewent on on a logarithmic scale himasyeah and we've got this mountain rangeand all that commentation going on herelike this is 180 billion sologarithmically there's a hugedifference to down here but a log scalehelps you see these things it's a reallynice example of why log scales help yousee detail when there's more than a feworders of magnitude going on but 138 didcollapse eventually so it now feels likea genuine question are there any thatdon't come back and the answeris we don't know of coursenot but there are a few interestingexamples so first of all let's hit theheadline and then we can go exploringthe jungle again if you like um if youdouble138 you get 276 which I may havementioned earlier um I'm going to runthat one on python for reasons if I runit on joji uh the thing melts right jojiis not a good processing thing for doingheavy duty calculations and you canimagine like in this one it had tofactorize a number in the hundreds ofbillions now it can do it but it's notquick and I hope all number of ourviewers are aware that factoring numberstakes a long time when they get big andthat's partly why the internet is stillsecure hooray uh python is better atdoing this stuff so I'm going to runthis on python I don't know if I cantake the excitement of another one likethat okay some badly written pythonscript here I'm actually going to run138 again so we can see how that lookshere it comes right that's it doing thenumber crunching that like we did onpaper that's the aloot sequence itreached an end which means it's going tostart animating it and now you can seethat mountain range we were commentingon is already doing a log scale by theway because I knew it was going to beimpossible to seeand the reason this is working moreefficiently is that it's done allcalculations first and it's just done alittle animation for me so I'm going todo this for 276 and you'll see whyimmediately I needed to do on pythonlet's just see what happens so here comethenumbers they're spitting out the bottomof my screen they're getting big rightit's given up it's got too large fortoday downhere and it gave up after 70 and alreadylike we're up at 70 steps 70 steps andit's gone beyond 10 the^ 13 but it couldcrunch to one in like a step it couldand I've gone a bit further and so haveothersand the reason I'm telling you aboutthis one is that we have not gone farenough to know and we've got thesupercomputers involved this has beenrunning on people's computers for a longtime it's the first number that wegenuinely don't know everything else upto 276 we've checked and it's eithercollapsed one or got in a loop uh andwe'll see some nice examples and we'vedone loads of other numbers too muchhigher and a lot of them all claps toone and go in Loops but this onesurprisingly low if you ask me we justdon't know and we do not have thecomputing power to get to the end of itand it hey The Next Step that someonecalculates you're right it mightcollapse we might hit a deficient streakbut these numbers you could hit aperfect number well you could we don'tmaybe this is an aspiring number likemaybe this one wants to be perfect andwe'll get there eventually but we don'tknow the Catalan Dixon conjecture saysmaybe all of them go to one or hit aperfect Loop but this is a counterexample if it doesn't we just don't knowhow to check if it does CU we haven'tgot the computing power so here's anunsolved problem with matics and what Ilike is this is low hanging fruit it'swithin that territory that a lot of usknow about with with recreational numberTheory perfect abundant deficientnumbers the 276 is the first of whatthey call the Lamer five he was amathematician he found five numbers lessthan a thousand that we don't know aboutare they all still open or they allstill open so there's other numbers lessthan a thousand that also we don't knowabout but they tap into the samesequence so for example if you try 306it does some stuff and then it slotsinto the same numbers that 276 does soyou end up with exactly the same graphin the same shape so they feel like lessunique but there are a few of them butthere are five with unique patterns thatare not coming down as far as we'vechecked under five and they are 276 552564 660 and966 and we just don't know do you wantto see what some other numbers do thatwe do know about yeah right let's let'sexplore the jungle a bit because thereare literally infinitely many numbers toexplore and the ones we have come acrosssome of them are nice all right first upfor your consideration I'm going to do98 0460 go go gadget aliquat sequence thenumbers will spit out first well onedivides 220 2 four five uh 10 what Ilike about this is that they missed apair in fact they missed the secondsmallest pair of amicable numbers andthese were found 200 years later it'snever going to hit five what we don'tknow well at the moment five is the onlyUntouchable number we found which is oddall of the others are even so unsolvedconjecture number two of this video isfive the only odd Untouchable number

Video script can we go old school Brady and talkabout a particular number yeah276 276 we'll do a deep dive into someunsolved problems in number theory ifyou're up for it pick a number whatabout like eight eight I'd like you totell me its factors or rathertechnically it's proper factors but allthat means is it's factors or devisersdepending on where you are in the worldnot including itself one two and fourand we're gonna add themup do you want to do that in your headyeah seven hey sothis is a process called the aliquatprocess this quat bit other words likequote and quotient all of which are todo with part of something and actuallyit's the first time I realized thatquote like you do a quote from someoneyou're telling us part of their speechlike and that's where the word quote iscome from but also quotient which is atechnical maass word for dividing thingslike dividing into different parts Ali Ithink Latin alas also Alias somethingother when you rename something to besomething else so this is like the otherparts so the alqua process is taking theproper factor of this number and addingup and you've got a number which islower than we started with but doing analqua sequence means doing it again soyou got seven go again tell me theproper factors and I hope you recognizethis is going to be quite quick yeah Imean that's just got one because we'renot doing seven itself so eight went toseven notice it went lower and sevenwent to one and actually if we carriedon one has no proper factors if we'regoing to Define that is not includingitself so you get zero but we might aswell stop there I'm saying that if youget to one it's kind of got boring atthat point then that's the end of oursequence your number that you choseeight got lower and actually that meanswe call eight a deficient number and Idon't know if that's a word you've comeacross before it certainly turned up onnumber file but whether you remember itlike every number is eitherdeficient or something else and I do youknow what else could happen if you pickhis proper factors and add it up I meanit could could add up to more than thenumber do you know what they call itlike Surplus uh yeah that's a good uhsynonym for the word I'm thinking ofwhich is the word abundant abundantthat's right I do so numbers could bedeficient like or abundant we can tryand pick an abundant number do you wantto try and guess one um the clue isactually a number with lots of factorswell let's try 24 because it is actuallyFour factorial but also like it'sfamously got lots of factors onetwo uh does three go in there it doesyeah three factors are also used touseful to do in pairs so if you've gottwo you could probably tell me 12because two * 12 and 3 * 8 is 24 4 * 6there's the six I was thinking of andI'm pretty sure we've run out andactually factor pairs are quite usefulyou sort of have to head towards themiddle 24 would go with the one butsince we're doing proper factors we'renot going to include it so let's justadd these up 20 3 6 we're found anabundant number Brady well done Eight'sdivision 24 is abundant and actuallylet's do the aliquat sequence becausethis time it's gone higher so if I takewhatever answer I get and do it againlet's go 36 36 has factors 1 2 and 18three goes in and I think that would be12 four goes in and that would be a ninewith it six is a factor as well prettysure those are all the factors can addthese up I mean if this needs fastforwarding ready you know what to do 3039 45 49 52 54 55 also abundant abundantbut I wonder if you can predict what'sgoing to happen now because thissequence I just keep doing it this iswhat an alqua sequence is and you justsee what happens so 55 uh 1 * 55 2 threeno none of those go in pretty sure it's5 * 11 and I think that's it doesn'tfeel like it's going to be abundantanymore 11+ 5 16 17 which is Prime and Ithink you know what happens to primesyou found one earlier it goes to onegame over here so this one took one twothree terms or fourth terms to get toone I'm not really too worried about butit looks like even when you started withan abundant number this thing eventuallyhits deficient and starts tracking backdown to one if it's not abundant ordeficient what else could it be theseare rhetorical questions because theseare called the perfect numbers ah lovelyyeah and so six is one of them if youtake the proper factor six one two andthree you add it to get six and if yousee if you do an alqua sequence on aperfect number it's never going to getto one unlike the other ones we'velooked that they will stick in a loop 28is famously perfect the next one is 496and they turn up and there's all sortsof stories we can tell why we neverfound an odd perfect number I'm notgetting into that as interesting as itis what I like about these alootsequences is they are doing things thatI already knew quite a lot about perfectnumbers abundant deficient but nowthere's another question which is if youkeep doing thisprocess what could happen is there anumber that never goes to one well we'veseen some that do go to one so we knowit can do that we've also talked aboutsome numbers which don't get to onebecause they're perfect what else couldhappen and I think there's some otherfamiliar landmarks we just haven'tspotted yet on the horizon we'd have tobe talking about numbers that when yousum their proper factors go into a loopcouldn't they just keep being abundantabundant abund there's the otherquestion um could you find an alootsequence that doesn't converge so let'sfirst of all establish the the loopthing famously 220 if you add up itsproper factors you get296 and if you add up the factors of 196the proper factors you get to 120 infact let me just get mykeys uh so I tot you want to find my mybunch of keys I don't at me rightthey're too big I know but this is thenumber 220 uh this is called an amicablenumber because it is best friends with296 those two go in a loop and if you dothe Alo quart sequence of either themyou just get the other one and this ishalf of a heart uh it's horribly clichedromantic to say that my wife has theother half of my heart and she has onewith the number 296 onthis is the lowest pair of amicablenumbers that exist okay so there there'sthe there's the loop what about foreverso the question is uh and this is now afamous piece of mathematics called theCatalan Dixon conjecture do all aliquatsequences either end in one or hit aperfect number and loop or amicablenumbers and in fact there are othercycles of what they call sociablenumbers which don't go in an amicablepair but they go in Loops uh and there'sa whole other branch of number theoryabout that but the Catalan Dixon conjectis do they all go into a loop or hitone and this is where you stop doing itby hand because it's easy to check thelow numbers and it becomes tedious tocheck the large numbers so we're goingto bust out some code okay so what I didwas program joj to take the properfactors have them up and then spit itback in and all it's going to do is plota little graph of where it goes so whatwe're expecting to see is abundantnumbers start with the graph going upand anytime you see a tick up in thegraph we've found an abundant number anddivision will go down perfect stay thesame and you're kind of stuck there solet's just do a quick check here is thenumber six I think you know what's goingto happen I've told it to give up afterlike six repeats so if I click go onthis the number six doesn't change it'sa perfect number your number that youstarted with was eight so let's go oneight and we're expecting it to dropstraight down went to seven went to oneand it's gone to zero and stoppedworking let's try the other one you didwhich is 24 and we're expecting thistime to to go up a bit better then itcomes down so now this I love about thissort of number Theory thing this isbasic maths but we've got an infinitenumber of numbers to explore and some ofthem are surprising so if we do do onethat we just talked about 220 there'sthat amicable pair bouncing around let'stry some other ones I'm going to try thenumber 95 because I know what happensand this has got a special name this iscalled an aspiring number uh and Ihadn't heard that term we've got a lotof these familiar sort of friendlynumber words like perfect abundantdeficient amicable sociable aspiring isone I hadn't come across but here's oneof them so here's a number that doesn'tget to one actually got to six and it'sstuck there so 95 is not perfect butit's almost there so it's aspiring to beperfect that's I think why they've namedit it knows the way to perfect it knowsthe way to perfect that's a gooddefinition of an aspiring number ifyou're using an alqua sequence and againI was like why have I I heard this wordand I actually asked a bunch ofrespected math math communicators andmathematicians and some of them haveheard it if they've done the number thethey're like of course I've heard of itand a bunch of us including myself werelike I've not heard this and yet I knowall the other numbers that come out ofthis little study so I enjoy like doingsomething new so 95 is aspiring that wasa new one for me let's try some othernumbers I'm going to try 30 so 30 lookat that I mean I'm sounding excitedbecause actually you try loads ofnumbers and they're deficient mostnumbers are deficient and they justshoot down and end at one 30 goes up forquite a long time it jumps up to thenumber260 and then it's all over and itcollapses down but here you have a firstGlimpse that some numbers go quite highbefore they come backdown 25 what you reckon 25 ends up beingaspiring cuz it goes to six straightaway uh and then it stays there so let'stry a more surprising number uh youdon't have to go very high to hit somesurprises I'm going to try the number138 if you are remembering the number Imentioned at the beginning just holdthat thought because it is connectedwith this uh and I hope that my jojprogramming skills let me get away withthis up and up and up and up oh down ohand up oh it's playing with you oh it'sa yes go son go never stop oh no no nono oh no it's back it's back I mean I'vedeliberately slowed this down to giveyou the chance to commentate so wellit's gone so high now we can't see anyof the blits earlier amazing oh no it'sdownagain it's down my computer is chuggingaway doing the calculations here oh noit doesn't look good but we saw it didit was looking like that before come oncome how long should we watch I mean ifit's still going it hasn't found aperfect number it's just that we can'tsee these numbers they're so smallcompared to the 18 billion that was uphere and at this point it hits one itstopped oh138 hits one but before it gets there ithit almost 18 billion hold on let let mecheck right so thousand million billion180 billionuh you do not want to do thatcalculation by hand what a ride that wasand I I enjoyed your commentary cuz thefirst time I programmed this and thefact that it went slowly enough like ifit was all over quickly you wouldn'thave seen any of those flips and youstill can't see them now right Ben youknow what we should start a YouTubechannel where we just pick a randomnumber where we just pick numbers andthen commentate the sequence let's do itlike marble racing we'll do some b-rollfootage of that in a minute but um theother problem is this is a niceobservation about like you can't see thejourney that fun time we had is vanishedin the in the week down here rightbecause this number is so big that theseare minis School in comparison so thisis a prime candidate for not plottingthis on a linear scale we're going touse a logarithmic scale and I'm justgoing to flip over to the log scale onthe screen and what that will do isinstead of plotting the number it willplot the basically the power of 10 andthat number how many digits that numberhas so I'm going to use log base 10 toplot it and I'm going to flip straightover to that there is the journey wewent on on a logarithmic scale himasyeah and we've got this mountain rangeand all that commentation going on herelike this is 180 billion sologarithmically there's a hugedifference to down here but a log scalehelps you see these things it's a reallynice example of why log scales help yousee detail when there's more than a feworders of magnitude going on but 138 didcollapse eventually so it now feels likea genuine question are there any thatdon't come back and the answeris we don't know of coursenot but there are a few interestingexamples so first of all let's hit theheadline and then we can go exploringthe jungle again if you like um if youdouble138 you get 276 which I may havementioned earlier um I'm going to runthat one on python for reasons if I runit on joji uh the thing melts right jojiis not a good processing thing for doingheavy duty calculations and you canimagine like in this one it had tofactorize a number in the hundreds ofbillions now it can do it but it's notquick and I hope all number of ourviewers are aware that factoring numberstakes a long time when they get big andthat's partly why the internet is stillsecure hooray uh python is better atdoing this stuff so I'm going to runthis on python I don't know if I cantake the excitement of another one likethat okay some badly written pythonscript here I'm actually going to run138 again so we can see how that lookshere it comes right that's it doing thenumber crunching that like we did onpaper that's the aloot sequence itreached an end which means it's going tostart animating it and now you can seethat mountain range we were commentingon is already doing a log scale by theway because I knew it was going to beimpossible to seeand the reason this is working moreefficiently is that it's done allcalculations first and it's just done alittle animation for me so I'm going todo this for 276 and you'll see whyimmediately I needed to do on pythonlet's just see what happens so here comethenumbers they're spitting out the bottomof my screen they're getting big rightit's given up it's got too large fortoday downhere and it gave up after 70 and alreadylike we're up at 70 steps 70 steps andit's gone beyond 10 the^ 13 but it couldcrunch to one in like a step it couldand I've gone a bit further and so haveothersand the reason I'm telling you aboutthis one is that we have not gone farenough to know and we've got thesupercomputers involved this has beenrunning on people's computers for a longtime it's the first number that wegenuinely don't know everything else upto 276 we've checked and it's eithercollapsed one or got in a loop uh andwe'll see some nice examples and we'vedone loads of other numbers too muchhigher and a lot of them all claps toone and go in Loops but this onesurprisingly low if you ask me we justdon't know and we do not have thecomputing power to get to the end of itand it hey The Next Step that someonecalculates you're right it mightcollapse we might hit a deficient streakbut these numbers you could hit aperfect number well you could we don'tmaybe this is an aspiring number likemaybe this one wants to be perfect andwe'll get there eventually but we don'tknow the Catalan Dixon conjecture saysmaybe all of them go to one or hit aperfect Loop but this is a counterexample if it doesn't we just don't knowhow to check if it does CU we haven'tgot the computing power so here's anunsolved problem with matics and what Ilike is this is low hanging fruit it'swithin that territory that a lot of usknow about with with recreational numberTheory perfect abundant deficientnumbers the 276 is the first of whatthey call the Lamer five he was amathematician he found five numbers lessthan a thousand that we don't know aboutare they all still open or they allstill open so there's other numbers lessthan a thousand that also we don't knowabout but they tap into the samesequence so for example if you try 306it does some stuff and then it slotsinto the same numbers that 276 does soyou end up with exactly the same graphin the same shape so they feel like lessunique but there are a few of them butthere are five with unique patterns thatare not coming down as far as we'vechecked under five and they are 276 552564 660 and966 and we just don't know do you wantto see what some other numbers do thatwe do know about yeah right let's let'sexplore the jungle a bit because thereare literally infinitely many numbers toexplore and the ones we have come acrosssome of them are nice all right first upfor your consideration I'm going to do98 0460 go go gadget aliquat sequence thenumbers will spit out first well onedivides 220 2 four five uh 10 what Ilike about this is that they missed apair in fact they missed the secondsmallest pair of amicable numbers andthese were found 200 years later it'snever going to hit five what we don'tknow well at the moment five is the onlyUntouchable number we found which is oddall of the others are even so unsolvedconjecture number two of this video isfive the only odd Untouchable number

Video script [Music]good day learners this is easyengineeringthis time we're going to talk aboutkinematics in physicsa big topic of study is mechanics thiscan be divided into two smaller topicswhich are the kinematics and dynamics inthis video we will only focus inkinematics and solving kinematicsproblemsto start with let us define kinematicskinematics is a branch of mechanicswhich deals with equations thatdescribes the motionof an object without external forcesnow we need to formalize ourselves withthis equationsin the first equation the distance d isequal to the initial velocityv sub i multiplied by time tplus one half of acceleration amultiplied by the square oftime t in the second equation the squareof final velocityis equal to the square of initialvelocity plus 2multiplied by the acceleration times thedistancein the third equation the final velocityis equal to the initial velocityplus the acceleration times the timein the fourth equation the distance isequal to the average velocity which isthe initial velocityplus the final velocity divided by 2multiplied by timeso let us try this equations by solvingproblemsfirst we have a problem concerninghorizontal motiona car starts from rest and acceleratesuniformlyover a time of 5.21 seconds for adistance of 110 metersnow determine the acceleration of thecarnow let us answer it we are given theinitial velocity which is 0 meters persecondbecause it start from rest next the timewhich is equal to5.21 seconds and distance which is equalto 110 meterswe are as for the acceleration of thecarso we need to find a formula that hasinitial velocitydistance time and acceleration theformula that suits for this problem isequation onenow we can input the known values andcompute for the accelerationand now we have the acceleration theacceleration would be equal to8.10 meters per second squarednow let's go to the second problem thesecond problem will be about verticalmotioncardo is riding the giant drop at greatamericaif cardo free falls for 2.60 secondswhat will be his final velocity and howfar will he fallwe are given the initial velocity whichis zero meters per second becausecardo experience free full motion nextthe time taken is equal to 2.60 secondsand the acceleration which is due togravity is 9.8 meters per second squaredlastly we are asked for his finalvelocityand the distance of his fall firstwe need to solve for the final velocitywe need to have a formula which hasinitial velocityacceleration and time and final velocitywe can say that equation 3 suits ourneeds for us to solve the final velocitywe then input the known values and solvefor the final velocityso the final velocity is equal to25.48 meters per secondnext we need to solve for the distanceof his fallsince we have now the final velocity wecan use the equation forwe then input the knownvalues and solve for the distanceso the distance of car does fall is33.12 meters[Music]even if we use equation 3 we will arrivethe same answernow let's try it we input initialvelocity and final velocityacceleration and solving for thedistanceso it is the same with with the value weget if we use equation 4 which is33.12 meterslastly let's go to a problem aboutprojectile motiona football is kicked with an initialvelocity of 25meters per second at an angle of 45degrees with a horizontaldetermine the time of flight thehorizontal displacement and the peakheight of the footballin this problem there are two dimensionsof motion hence we need to separate thexand y components first we need toresolveinto x and y component the initialvelocitythe x component of the initial velocityis equal tov sub i cosine thetaso we have so as the y component of theinitial velocityis equal to v sub i multiplied to sinethetaso we have we have now the initialvelocityalong x and initial velocityalong y we are asked to find the time offlight firstwhen the ball reaches the maximum heightits final velocity along y is equal tozero meters per secondso we can use equation three to find thetime twe will only account the y component asthe a sub y is the acceleration along ycomponent which isdue to gravity which is the g is equalto negative 9.8 meters per secondsquaredthe negative value indicates that theacceleration's direction is downwardthen we input the non-values and solvingfor timet which gives us the 1.804seconds but this time t only accountsthe time when the ball reaches themaximum height so to solve for the totalflight of the ballwe just need to multiply it by 2 so thetotal time tis equal to 3.61 secondsnext we ask for the horizontaldisplacementthis is an x component we can useequation 4 to solve for the displacementso we will be havingwe then input the known values take notethat the velocity along x component isconstantso the initial velocity along x is equalto the final velocityalong y and the time we use will be thetotal time for the ball to reach thegroundwhich gives us d d subx which is this 63.82 meterslastly to find its maximum height westill useequation four but this timethe time we use will be the half of thetotal time because this is the time thatthe ballreaches its peak height so we will haveand then we input the known values whichgives us the15 15.95 metersso to sum up the time of flight of theball is3.61 seconds the horizontal distancetraveledof the ball is 63.82 meters and the peakheightis 15.95 metersso that's it so did you enjoy our topicfor todayi hope you certainly did see you againnext time for more interesting and funtopics only here in easy engineeringwe make engineering topics easy and funfor youyou

Video script Do subscribe to Ekeeda  Channel and pressbell icon to get updates about latestengineering HSC and IIT JEE main andadvanced videos Hello Friends in the lastlecture we have studied that thefor a strong electrolyte  we could easilycalculate the lambda naught that is themaximum limiting value for the strongelectrolyte formula conductivity but forme correctly it was very much hectic andit was cannot be finerbut for this thing we have helped butfor this thing we have bought anequation which is based on corner tablefrom where we could find the lambdanaught that is the maximum limitingvalue for the molar conductivity so letus see what is for rationalso before understanding what is scholarso let us understand what is thedefinition of the cockroach law and whatdoes it states it states that andinfrared diffusion each is my greatestindependently of its coil and make itscontribution to the total molarconductivity of the electricirrespective of the nature of its ID itsays that an infinite dilution thecation and an N the both contribute someamount of the molar conductivity for thewhole electronic and in this case thecation and irrespective of the nature ofits cohen and has my calculating this toMunna conductivities of a cation andbullock and rittany of an NN we couldestimate that what would be the molarconductivity of a particular solution atinfinite tension for that case we havederive the formula in this way wherelambda naught is the molar conductivityof a particular solution or of aparticular enabling infinite dilution sofor that it is the combination of molarconductivity of the ion that is molarconductivity of the cation and infinitedilution and molar conductivity of andthen at infinite dilutionsso this makes where lambda naught ofplus is nothing but molar conductivityof Quettaat infinite dilution while lambda knotof - that it it is mula conductivity ofni at infinite dilution so by the helpof this we could estimate what would bethe molar conductivity of a particularelectrolyte for example if I consider anexample like this one if you know themolar conductivity of KCl and if we knowthe molar conductivity of NaCl so bythis we could estimate what would be theoverall molar conductivity of thatparticular solution so let me give anexample of that if I consider the molarconductivity of KCl then I could writein this way that is lambda naught of kplus plus lambda naught of CL minus- of lambda not of any plus plus lambdanot of CN - in this case I could writeit in this way like lambda not of k plusplus lambda not of CL - which is minusof lambda not of any plus minus lambdanaught of CN - in this case we could seethat this lambda naught of CL and thislemon out of case Allah has been tensealone and what we have got is lambdanaught of k plus minus lambda naught ofna plus and it has been found that themolar conductivity of this cation and ofthat is for potassium and for the sodiumthe difference was found to be the sameas if we have taken a solution and wehave described a solution for ki and measo let us see what will be the value inthat situation so if I consider lambdanaught of ki minus lambda naught of Nand if I have calculated all of her tryto determine what would be the molarconductivity of this cations then theanswer would be written as in this wayand it's lambda naught of k plus pluslambda naught of I minus I I letindirectly minus lambda naught of anyplus minus lambda out of I minus in thiscase this two will cancel out each otherand the rest that will remain with me islambda naught of k plus minus lambdanaught of an A plusso in this case as we could see that theboth have the same in that is lambdanaught of k plus minus lambda naught ofany plus while here in this case alsolambda naught of k plus minus lambdanaught of endless someans that this two equations that wehave derived or that we have estimatedthe both are not dependent on thatparticular and so this shows that themolar conductivity of a particularelectrolyte depends individually on itscation as it depends individually on itsand then also so this plays a very vitalrole in showing that the cations alsocontribute their value for the totalmolar conductivity of a particleelectrolyte in a solution for examplesuppose this Quadra flow is very muchvalidate or it is very much influentialto calculate the molar productivity of aweak electrolyte how let me do if Iconsider strong it rides like the lambdanaught of X in the lambda naught ofsodium acetate and the lambda of M ishere in this case all the three are verystrong electrolytes and with the help ofthis values we could estimate what wouldbe the value of the V electric supposein this case I need the weak electrolytelike acetic acid to be estimated thevalue of the molar conductivity to beestimated how can I do that see it isvery much simple the lambda naught ofch3cooh can be calculated in a formwhere if I sum up the lambda naught ofsodium acetate and exhale and if I ameliminated or if I subtract this valuethat is lambda naught of Arison then Icould possibly get the value of thelambda naught for acetic acid or themolar conductivity at infinite attentionfor acetic acid let us seeso if I add up ch3coo ne plus lambdanaught of HCl minus lambda naught ofNECN in this case what I could get islambda out of ch3co for minus pluslambda naught of na plus plus in forthis case lambda naught 4-h plus minuslambda naught say plus lambda naught ofC n minus 1 in this case I would getminus lambda naught of na plus y minuslambda naught of CL minus so in thiscase if I observe I could see that thisna plus and this NFS we cancel out eachother when this CL and this CL value ofthe molar conductivity of the entitiesin case of cl minus they will cancel outeach other and the thing that is leftwith me is lambda naught of ch3co minusplus lambda naught of h plus and thenthis are no the sum of the molarconductivity of a particular cation andmolar conductivity of a fatima NN atinfinite dilution and this will give anoverall value of the molar conductivityof a weak electrolyte so this is how thecorrosion law has helped to estimate thevalue of the molar conductivity of avehicle a plate at infinite dimensionalsoup which was not been estimated ingraphically that we have did earlier sothis was the most important thing thatwe have learned now so thank you friendsfor watching this video I hope you haveliked this video and even share thisvideo with your friends and please don'tforget to subscribe you get a channelthank you so much

Video script - [Voiceover] The first,
I guess you could say,modern conception of an acid and basecomes from this gentleman right over here,Svante Arrhenius, and he was actuallythe third recipient of the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry in 1903.And his definition of
acids, under his definitionof acids and bases, an acid
is something that increasesthe concentration, increasesthe concentration, concentrationof Hydrogen protons,and we can say protonswhen put in an aqueous solution,when in aqueous, aqueous solution,and that's just a water solution.And then you can imagine
what a base would be.You could think, oh
maybe a base is somethingthat decreases the protons and that'sone way to think about it.Or you could say, it decreases,or actually let me
write this, it increasesthe hydroxide concentration.It increases the hydroxide concentration.when put in aqueous solution.When in aqueous, aqueous solution.So let's make that concrete.Let's look at some examples.So a strong Arrhenius acid, and actually,this would be a strong acid
by other definitions as well,would be hydrochloric acid.Hydrochloric acid,you put it in a an aqueous solution.So that's the hydrogen.You have the chlorine.You put it in an aqueous solution.You put it in an aqueous solution,it will readily disassociate.This is a, this reaction occurs,strongly favors moving
from the left to right.You're going to have
the chlorine strip offthe two electrons in the
covalent bond with the hydrogen,leaving the hydrogen with no electrons,so the hydrogen is just goingto be left as a hydrogen proton.And then the chlorine,the chlorine has just
nabbed that electron.It had the electrons it had
before, and then it just nabbedan electron from the
hydrogen, and so it now hasa negative charge, and these areboth in aqueous solution still.It's still, they're still
both dissolved in the water.And so you see very clearly here,you put this in an aqueous solution,you're going to increase the amount of,you're going to increase
the amount of hydrogen ions,the amount of protons in the solution.And we've talked about this before,you'll often see a
reaction written like this,but the hydrogen protons,
they just don't sit thereby themselves in the water.They are going to bond with the watermolecules to actually form hydronium.So another way that you'll
often see this is like this.You have the hydrochloric acid,hydrochloric acid.It's in an aqueous solution,just a fancy way of saying
it's dissolved in the water,and then you have the H2O.You have the water molecules,H2O, and you'll sometimes see written,okay, it's in its liquid form,and it's going to yield.Instead of just saying that
you have a hydrogen ionright over here, you'll
say, "Okay, that thing,"the hydrogen is actually gonna get bonded"to a water molecule."And so what you're gonna be left withis actually H3O.Now this thing, this was a water molecule,and all it got was a hydrogen ion.All that is is a proton.It didn't come with any electrons,so now this is going to
have a positive charge.It's going to have a positive charge,and we could now say
that this is going to bein an aqueous solution, hydroniumis going to be in an aqueous solution,and you're going to have plus,now you're going to still
have the chloride ion,or it's a negative ion,
so we call it an anion.Chloride, chloride anion,and this is still in an aqueous solution.It is dissolved in water,and remember all that happened hereis that the chlorine here
took all of the electrons,leaving hydrogen with none.Then that hydrogen proton gets
nabbed by a water moleculeand becomes hydronium.So even by this definition you might sayit increases the concentration
of hydrogen protons.You could say it increase the
concentration of hydronium,of hydronium right over here.Hydronium ions.So that makes, by the
Arrhenius definition,that makes hydrochloric
acid a strong acid.That makes it astrong acid.Now what would be a strong base
by the Arrhenius definitionof acids and bases?Well one would be sodium hydroxide.So let me write that down,so if I have sodium hydroxide,sodium Na, that's the sodium,and then I have the hydroxide.That's an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen.So that's sodium hydroxide, and actuallyif you wanted to see what
this molecule looked likeyou have a oxygen having a covalent bondto a hydrogen.Let me do these in different colors.Oxygen has a covalent bondto a hydrogen.to a hydrogen right over here.And it actually has three alone pairs.It actually has three alone
pairs right over here.It's actually nabbed the electron from,from somebody some place,and so it's going to
have a negative charge.It is going to have a negative charge.Actually I could write it both,let me just write it like that.It has a negative charge,and then you have a sodium ionthat has lost its electron somehow.So you have a sodium ion that has lostan electron somehow, so
it has a positive charge,and for all we know, it
could have lost the electronto the oxygen right over
here, making the oxygennegative and making the sodium positive,and so this is now
positive, this is negative,they're going to be
attracted to each other,and they form an ionic bond,so sodium hydroxide,
they have an ionic bondbecause the sodium is actually positive,and the hydroxide part right over here.That is negative,and that's what draws them together,but anyway, you put this
in an aqueous solution.You throw some sodium hydroxide
into an aqueous solution,it will disassociate into,into sodium with its positive
charge, the sodium ions,and actually you know the sodium
ion is still part of this.That's what makes it attracted
to the hydroxide anion,but it's still going to bein an aqueous solution,and then you're going
to have the hydroxide.You're going to have the hydroxide anion,so essentially this
thing just disassociates.This has a negative charge,and it's still going to
be dissolved in the water,so aqueous solution.So you throw sodium hydroxide in water,it's going to increase the concentration.It's going to increase the
concentration of hydroxidein the water.It's going to increase the
hydroxide concentration,and so by the Arrhenius
definition of acids and bases,this would be a strong Arrhenius base.This would be a strong,a strong base by the Arrhenius definition.Now, and I encourage you to look at thatrelative to the other definitions,the Bronsted-Lowry
definition of acids and basesand the Lewis definition
of acids and bases,and see how you would think
about categorizing things.

Video script now the next property that we're goingto discuss is the electron gain enthalpyor as some books quote it as theelectron affinity but I'll tell you theyboth are closely related but they arenot exactly the same now during theaddition of an electron there could betwo possibilities of energies either theenergy is given out or the energy isabsorbed now there is a sign conventionthat we'll be following for electrongain enthalpy where if the energy isreleased by the atom while accepting anelectron that would be termed asnegative and if we have to supply energyto make the electron go inside the atomthen we would call it as positive sothere would be four terms which could bethere that is more negative lessnegative more positive or less positivenow when and why would we used thenegative and the positive we'll justtake a look now let's say I have sodiumand I have magnesium withright now if I want to add an electronto each one of them will the electrongain enthalpy have a positive value or anegative value think see now sodium andmagnesium both are metals and since theyare metals they would not want to takeelectron so they will oppose theaddition of electron so that means wewould have to give energy in order toadd the electron to either one of themright so that means for Metals theelectron gain enthalpy can never have anegative value it would always be talkedin terms of positive that is you willhave to supply energy now the questioncomes out of the two which one wouldhave more positive electron gainenthalpy and which one would have lesspositive electron gain enthalpy right sohear carefully what words am I using nowout of sodium and magnesium which one issmaller in sizeyes magnesium is smaller in size so nowwhat happens the nuclear force ofattraction on the electron why magnesiumis more because the size of magnesium issmaller and in the case of sodium sincethe size of sodium is Big the amount ofnuclear force on the same electron islesser so that means in a way thenuclear force of magnesium is helping meout in attracting the electron but thenucleus of sodium is not helping me outso in both the cases I am givingenergies but because that small amountof help I I'm getting from the Magnesiumatom so the amount of energy that I haveto supply to magnesium for accepting theelectron would be less as compared tosodium so in the cases of metal theelectron gain enthalpy would always havea positive value and the one which has asmaller size or a higher nuclear chargewould be the one which would have alesser positive electron gain enthalpyand the other one would have a higherpositive electron gain enthalpy right sotwo factors which we have taken care ofover here on which electron gainenthalpy is depending is the nuclearcharge and the atomic size now let'stake another example where we'llconsider two non-metals right so let'stake sulfur and let's take chlorine sothe electronic configuration for sulfurwould have 3p4 and for chlorine it wouldbe3p5 now if I put one electron over herewhich one do you think would accept theelectron first and become more stableyes it would be chlorine because if ittakes one electron it achieves the noblegas configuration so that means thestability for chlorine after acceptingthe electron is increasing so it wouldremove the maximum amount of energy sothat is why in the case of chlorine andsulfur because of the electronicconfiguration the electron gain enthalpyof chlorine would be more negative ascompared to sulfur now let's take a lookwith another property now if I have theatomic radius concentations then theatomic radius of chlorine is smaller ascompared to sulfur then again the amountof nuclear force or the amount of forcethat the nucleus would have on thiselectron would be more in the case ofchlorine and the electron would be moreattracted towards chlorine as comparedto sulfur the second condition alsofavors chlorine and this is why chlorinewould have a more negative electron gainenthalpy value now why negative overhere because it's a nonmetal andnon-metals have a tendency to accept anelectron so for accepting an electronthey would release energy that is why inthe cases of metal we were saying thatthe electron gain enthalpy would alwaysbe positive and in the cases ofnon-metals it would always be negativeright so the third Factor on whichelectron gain enthalpy is depending isthe electron is the electronicconfiguration right so with theelectronic configuration if there is anyelement which has a half fill or a fullyfilled subshell that would have a verylow electron gain enthalpy now dependingon if it is a metal or a non-metal wewould judge that will it have a positivevalue or a negative value but pleasetake into consideration the electronicconfiguration also so the three factorson which electron gain enthalpy isdepending is the atomic radius thenuclear charge and the electronicconfiguration so now if we talk aboutthe periodic trends or the periodicityfor electron gain enthalpy then let metell you for electron gain enthalpy youwill not be able to have a properperiodic trend because you your valuewould keep on changing depending on whatare you taking so I cannot say or Icannot generalize that moving from leftto right in a period it should increaseor decrease or moving down the group itshould increase or decrease it alldepends onthe examples that you are taking now letme introduce the electron affinity thatwe were discussing now Affinity is theword that indicates love that iselectron loving so the actual definitionfor electron affinity is it is thenegative of the electron gain enthalpyso wherever the electron gain enthalpyhad a positive value electron affinitywill become negative and wherever theelectron gain enthalpy had a negativevalue the electron affinity would becomepositive so that means if there is anelement or an atom which loves electronsor which would want to attract theelectron to itself there you would saythat the electron affinity is positiveand the ones which do not want to takethe electrons there the electronaffinity would be negative now I saidthat the electron affinity would is veryclosely related to electron gainenthalpy now if you talk in terms ofthermodynamics then the enthalpy that isthe electron gain enthalpy and theelectron affinity has a relationshipwhere the electron gain enthalpy isequal to the electron affinity minus 5x2* of RT now that value R is theuniversal gas constant and T is thetemperature in Kelvin scale so usingthis relationshipwe can find out what is the value ofelectron affinity if the value ofelectron gain enthalpy is given to youor what is the value of electron gainenthalpy if the value of electronaffinity is given to you now let usdiscuss few exceptions which arise inthe case of electron gain enthalpy thefirst prominent exception that is therefor electron gain enthalpy is which willhave a higher negative electron gainenthalpy value when you compare Florineand chlorine now the logic says thatFlorine has a very small size so theelectron gain enthalpy would be verynegative for Florine because it willabsorb the electron very easily now forchlorine chlorine also has the sameelectronic configuration so it can alsoabsorb the electron easily but the sizeof chlorine being smaller gives it theupper hand but that is not the correctanswer the correct answer is thechlorine has a higher negative electrongain enthalpy value now why becauseFlorine has a very small size right andin the outermost shell there are sevenelectrons so now in a very small spaceseven electrons are already present andif I bring in the eighth electron wouldthe seven electrons allow the Earthelectron to come in no they would startrepelling and they would not let thatone electron come in so what is actuallyhappening there is one attractive forcefrom the nucleus to the incomingelectron but there are seven electronelectron repulsions which are forcingthe electron not to come in so there youwould have to supply energy in order tomake it f minus so that means a positiveelectron gain enthalpy is happening nowin the case of chlorine the outermostshell can easily accommodate 18electrons and only seven electrons arepresent so the incoming electron wouldnot have a problem while coming in so ahigher negative electron gain enthalpyvalue is for chlorine so that is why thegraph if we plot for electron gainenthalpy looks something like this itshould have been something like this butthis anomalousBehavior makes the graph look like thisright so this is about the Florine andchlorine example now one such exceptionis also there between oxygen and sulfurthere also the same thing happens foroxygen that is the smallest the secondsmallest element for us where in theoutermost shell there are six electronsand for sulfur in the outermost shellthere are again six electrons but foroxygen the maximum number of electronsthat can be accommodated in the secondshell is eight so similarly if oneelectron is trying to come in there aresix electron electron repulsionshappening but in the case of sulfur thatis not true so so the higher negativeelectron gain enthalpy value is forsulfur and not for oxygen so these arethe two exceptions that you should havein mind now which one would you thinkwill have the highest negative electrongain enthalpy values yes it would be forthe halogens the halogens would be theones which would have the highestnegative electron gain enthalpy valuesnow there are some examples which havealmost zero electron gain enthalpyvalues like berum and magnesiumor nitrogen and phosphorus why becausefor berium and magnesium the electronicconfiguration is 2s2 and 3s2 where wehave a fully filled electronicconfiguration so if I'm trying to put inan electron what am I doing I'mdistorting the electronic configurationand if I'm distorting the electronicconfiguration that would not go wellwith the atom so atom would not want totake that electron and that is why theelectron gain enthalpy value for berumand magnesium is almost zero or it's avery low value and similarly in nitrogenand phosphorus the electronicconfigurations have 2p3 and 3p3 valueswhich is a half- fill electronicconfiguration and again because of thesame reason that if the incomingelectron comes in the half-fillsubshells would be broken off and hencea decrease in stability will take placethat is why the electron gain enthalpyis not favored for that so it has a verylow value now if like in ionizationenthalpy we had the success I ionizationenthalpies where I was trying to removefirst electron second electron thirdelectron similarly for electron gainenthalpies also we have successiveelectron gain enthalpies where I add oneelectron then I add the second electronand if required I can add the thirdelectron also but now what happens overhere suppose if I take the example ofoxygen and I put one electron in it sowhat do you think the value should benegative or positive the value would benegative because it will be movingcloser to the stable noble gasconfiguration right so the value issomewhere around minus 140 KJ per molenow if I add one more electron to itwhat should happen should it be anegative electron gain enthalpy value ora positive electron gain enthalpy valuethink the normal logic says that itshould be a negative electron gainenthalpy value because it is O minus nowso if I bring in one more electron itwill reach the noble gas configurationso it should be easier but no at thesame time you have to see that when thatelectron has added the size of oxygenbecomes bigger and if the size of oxygenbecomes bigger the attractive force ofthe nucleus on the incoming electrondecreases and that is why the secondelectron gain enthalpy for oxygen ishaving a positive value and it is closeto somewhere around 700 KJ per mole nowremember this fact that whenever asecond electron gain enthalpy ishappening or you're trying to add thesecond electron it would always have apositive value right it will never havea negative value because the increase insize would be given more prominence ascompared to anything else so this isabout the electron gain enthalpy now ifI correlate the electron gain enthalpywith the electron affinity for thislet's take an example of oxygen andsodium for oxygen we know that theelectron gain enthalpy has a negativevalue and for sodium it has a positiveelectron gain enthalpy value right nowif I say electron affinity out of thetwo which has more electron affinity itis oxygen right so oxygen would have apositive electron affinity and forsodium because sodium does not loveelectrons so it would have a negativeelectron affinity so this is how we saythat electron affinity is the negativeof the electron gain enthalpy sowherever you have an atom which is anon-metal the non-metals would alwayshave a higher electron affinity that isa positive electron affinity and themetals would always have a negativeelectron affinity so don't confuseyourself with electron gain enthalpy andelectron affinityright

Video script its professor David let's talk about the
periodic tablepretty much everyone knows with this is
even if they don't know much aboutchemistry. it's the periodic table of the
elements which at first seems like arandom arrangement of substances most of
which sounds strange and foreign but theway the elements are arranged reveals
many beautiful patterns that tell usabout how nature operates. in the mid
1800's lots of chemists were trying tocome up with a way to depict all the
elements in table form and manydifferent formats were proposed but it
was the one by Dmitri Mendeleev thatstuck because of how well it correlates
data as well as its predictive powers. hearranged the elements into rows called
periods and columns called groupselements that had similar behavior were
put in groups together which helped tocorrelate existing data and it also
predicted the existence of elements thathad never been seen before. with the gaps
in the table Mendeleev said there mustbe elements that go in these spots and
he predicted some of their propertieseventually these elements were
discovered with the properties preciselyas expected and now we have all the
metals, metalloids and nonmetalsorganized nicelyit wasn't known at the time but the
reason elements in the same group behavesimilarly is because they have the same
number of valence electrons. look atgroup one for example, these elements all
have one valence electron or oneelectron in their outermost shell. as you
go down the table and n increases yougain a shell each time but whichever is
the outermost shell there is only oneelectron in it. every element in group 2
has two electrons in its outermost shelland so forththis simple fact determines many
characteristics about each element inways we will continue to see as we learn
more chemistry. there are some periodictrends that we can recognize when we
look at the table. the first one isatomic radius or the size of the atom. as
we proceed downward on the tableatomic size increases because we add
shells. as we go to the rightatomic radius decreases because we are
moving within a shell and each elementto the right has one more proton in the
nucleus than the lastso there is a stronger electromagnetic
attraction felt by the electrons and theradius shrinks, that means overall atomic
radius increases going this way on theperiodic tableionic radius is a little different,
electrons repel each other so adding anelectron makes an atom bigger. taking one
away makes it smallerions with the same electron
configuration will have their radiidecrease as the atomic number increasesnext we look at ionization energy. this
is the energy required to remove anelectron from the atom. it will always be
an electron in the outermost shell. theelectromagnetic force that attracts the
electrons to the protons drops off veryquickly with distance so the farther
away an electron is from the nucleusthe easier it is to pull it away. this
means the ionization energy trend isprecisely the opposite of the atomic
radius trend. francium, a very largeatom with only one valence electron will
be easy to ionize because the electronis so far away from the nucleus and
atoms like to have their outermost shellcompletely fulllosing the electron means this shell is
gone and the one below is completelyfull so elements in group 1 will easily
lose one electron. looking at theopposite corner with helium there is
only one shell so the electrons are veryclose to the nucleus, and the shell is
full so it is very stable. for thisreason it requires much more energy to
ionize helium so the ionization energyincreases going this way on the periodic
table. elements can have successiveionization energies for removing more
than one electron. a second ionizationenergy will always be greater than the
first and continue to increase fromthere since the more electrons you
remove the less stable the atom becomesan element will have a huge jump in
ionization energy after you take thelast one in a shell because then you
jump to the noble gas electronconfiguration from the previous shell
which is full so it really won't want togive up any more electrons. there are
just a couple exceptions to theionization energy trend but we can
rationalize them. look for example at thesecond row from lithium to neon. the
ionization energy should increase eachtime we add a proton to the nucleus and
the radius contracts a little bitsomething like oxygen which dips
downwards from nitrogen's ionizationenergy does so because of orbital
symmetry. here is nitrogens orbitaldiagram as well as oxygen's. notice that
nitrogen's 2p orbitals are preciselyhalf fullthis gives nitrogen a special stabilityjust like elements that have a full
outermost shell. if nitrogen loses anelectron it loses that special stability
but if oxygen loses an electron it willgain that special stability, that's why
oxygen's ionization energy is a littlebit lower than nitrogen's even though
oxygen has one additional proton. alldeviations from the ionization energy
trend can be explained by discrepanciesin orbital symmetry like this onenext we will look at electron affinity.
this is exactly the opposite ofionization energy since ionization
energy is how much energy you need toremove an electron and electron affinity
tells us how much an atom wants to gainan electron. disregarding the noble gases
as their shells are fullelectron affinity increases this way.
fluorine has the highest electronaffinity because if it gains
one electron it will have a full shellor noble gas electron configuration.
looking at the opposite corner theseelements don't want to gain electrons
they would rather lose themexceptions to this trend happen for
exactly the same reasons as theexceptions to the ionization energy
trend. lastly we want to look atelectronegativity, this is the ability of
an atom to hold electrons tightly. itwill increase this way because a smaller
atom like fluorine with more protons forits energy level or higher effective
nuclear charge will hold electrons bestagain we will disregard the noble gases
for this trend. electronegativity will beimportant in the next clip where we
learn about chemical bonds. so thetrends to remember are atomic radius
which goes this way as well asionization energy, electron affinity, and
electronegativity which all go this waylet's check comprehensionthanks for watching guys subscribe to my

Video script in chemistry finding the oxidationnumbers for elements in compounds andions is really a key skillso in this video you'll learn the rulesfor assigning oxidation numbers and thenpractice to develop your skills and yourmemory so let's build some rules we'llput the most important rules firstrule one the oxidation numbers of eachindividual atom in a neutral compoundthose oxidation numbers they add up tozeroa neutral compound doesn't have a plusor minus charge after like the ions doso pause and classify these substancesas either neutral compounds or ionsso let's find the oxidation numbers fora neutral compound co2 carbon dioxidewe'll learn later that oxygen usuallyhas an oxidation number of minus twoso based on this information and thefact that the oxidation numbers for allthe atoms in a neutral compound have toadd up to zeropause and figure out the oxidationnumber on the carbon in co2it's helpful to think of this as anequation here we know that each of theoxygens has an oxidation of -2we don't know the oxidation number forthe carbon so we can say carbon is x wedon't know thatplusthe minus 2 for the oxygen we have thetwo oxygensand that has to equal the zero becausethe oxidation numbers in a neutralcompound add up to zero so to solve theequation x minus fourequals zerox that equals positive four and that'sthe oxidation number on the carbonin co2 if we add all these oxidationnumbers up we have 2 times -2 that'sminus 4 plus 4that gives us 0.an extension to the first rule is thatwhen we have ions this positive ornegative charge after the compoundall of the oxidation numbers for theatoms and ions they add up to the chargeon the ionso pause and try to find the oxidationnumber for each element in so42 minusthe sulfate ionwe know oxygen has a minus two oxidationnumber so we say sulfur that's x plusminus two times four we have four oxygenatoms equals the charge on the ionso we solve for xand we find that x equalsplus six and that's the oxidation numberon the sulfur in so4 two minusso speaking of oxidation numbers andionic charge the big thing to rememberis that while they do overlap someoxidation number and ionic charge arenot the same thingfor example the ionic charge fornitrogen is always going to be threeminus when we look at the oxidationnumber for nitrogen it changes it can bedifferent things for example in n2o it'splus fourbut in no it's plus twothe key thing to rememberoxidation numbers and ionic charges arenot the same thingthe next rule it's easythe oxidation number for free elementsalso called monatomic substances wherethere's only one type of atom in thesubstance those are zeroso pause and find the oxidation numberfor these substancesremember for ions like c a two plus or fminus the oxidation number is equal tothe chargeanother straightforward rule is thatfluorine f is always minus onepause and give these a tryso in the first one this is a littlestrange here we have oxygen is plus twobut that's because fluorine is alwaysgoing to be minus onetwo fluorines two times minus one that'sminus two the oxygen has to be plus twoand i hope i didn't catch you with thef2 here it's a neutral compound and allthe atoms are the same so its oxidationnumber is zeroin this next rule oxidation number andionic charge do overlap on the periodictable elements in group one have a oneplus charge their oxidation number isplus one group two has an oxidationnumber of plus two and aluminum in groupthirteen sometimes called three a isplus threeso pause and try thesenote that for na2o2 sodium peroxideoxygen doesn't have a minus 2 chargehere it's -1 peroxides they're anexception for the rule that oxygen has aminus 2 oxidation numberi mean how many more rules are therejust a fewan important one is that hydrogen has aplus 1 oxidation number when it's bondedto nonmetalswhen it's bonded to metals it's minusonehere's the periodic table divided intometals and nonmetals so pause and findthe oxidation numbers for the elementsin these compoundsnote that in lih the hydrogen's negativeand it's written after the metal afterthe lithiumokay two more rules this one's importantoxygen is usually -2 with two bigexceptions do you remember themwhen bonded to fluorine and in peroxideso pause and find the oxidation numbersfor each element in these compoundslet's give clo3 minus a trywe know that oxygen has an oxidationnumber of minustwo we also know that we have an ionhere so all the oxidation numbers aregoing to add up to the charge on the ionso let's figure out the oxidation numberfor chlorinewe could say chlorine call that xminus two for the oxygen there are threeoxygen atomsequals the charge on the ion minus onex minus six equals minus onexthat equals plusfive and that's the oxidation number onthe chlorineso we found the one that we knew theoxygen which is minus two we know thatit all has to add up to a negative 1because of the charge here and we usethat information to find the oxidationnumber on the chlorinethe last ruleif none of the rules above apply you canuse these rules in this order so pauseone last time and give these a tryso we've done a bunch of practice inthis video but to really get it andreally remember you need some morepractice so in the description to thisvideo and also at the end you'll findlinks to more practicethis is dr b with how to calculate theoxidation number for elements indifferent compounds and if you made itthis far thanks for watching

number of valence electrons. look atgroup one for example, these elements all
have one valence electron or oneelectron in their outermost shell. as you
go down the table and n increases yougain a shell each time but whichever is
the outermost shell there is only oneelectron in it. every element in group 2
has two electrons in its outermost shelland so forththis simple fact determines many
characteristics about each element inways we will continue to see as we learn
more chemistry. there are some periodictrends that we can recognize when we
look at the table. the first one isatomic radius or the size of the atom. as
we proceed downward on the tableatomic size increases because we add
shells. as we go to the rightatomic radius decreases because we are
moving within a shell and each elementto the right has one more proton in the
nucleus than the lastso there is a stronger electromagnetic
attraction felt by the electrons and theradius shrinks, that means overall atomic
radius increases going this way on theperiodic tableionic radius is a little different,
electrons repel each other so adding anelectron makes an atom bigger. taking one
away makes it smallerions with the same electron
configuration will have their radiidecrease as the atomic number increasesnext we look at ionization energy. this
is the energy required to remove anelectron from the atom. it will always be
an electron in the outermost shell. theelectromagnetic force that attracts the
electrons to the protons drops off veryquickly with distance so the farther
away an electron is from the nucleusthe easier it is to pull it away. this
means the ionization energy trend isprecisely the opposite of the atomic
radius trend. francium, a very largeatom with only one valence electron will
be easy to ionize because the electronis so far away from the nucleus and
atoms like to have their outermost shellcompletely fulllosing the electron means this shell is
gone and the one below is completelyfull so elements in group 1 will easily
lose one electron. looking at theopposite corner with helium there is
only one shell so the electrons are veryclose to the nucleus, and the shell is
full so it is very stable. for thisreason it requires much more energy to
ionize helium so the ionization energyincreases going this way on the periodic
table. elements can have successiveionization energies for removing more
than one electron. a second ionizationenergy will always be greater than the
first and continue to increase fromthere since the more electrons you
remove the less stable the atom becomesan element will have a huge jump in
ionization energy after you take thelast one in a shell because then you
jump to the noble gas electronconfiguration from the previous shell
which is full so it really won't want togive up any more electrons. there are
just a couple exceptions to theionization energy trend but we can
rationalize them. look for example at thesecond row from lithium to neon. the
ionization energy should increase eachtime we add a proton to the nucleus and
the radius contracts a little bitsomething like oxygen which dips
downwards from nitrogen's ionizationenergy does so because of orbital
symmetry. here is nitrogens orbitaldiagram as well as oxygen's. notice that
nitrogen's 2p orbitals are preciselyhalf fullthis gives nitrogen a special stabilityjust like elements that have a full
outermost shell. if nitrogen loses anelectron it loses that special stability
but if oxygen loses an electron it willgain that special stability, that's why
oxygen's ionization energy is a littlebit lower than nitrogen's even though
oxygen has one additional proton. alldeviations from the ionization energy
trend can be explained by discrepanciesin orbital symmetry like this onenext we will look at electron affinity.
this is exactly the opposite ofionization energy since ionization
energy is how much energy you need toremove an electron and electron affinity
tells us how much an atom wants to gainan electron. disregarding the noble gases
as their shells are fullelectron affinity increases this way.
fluorine has the highest electronaffinity because if it gains
one electron it will have a full shellor noble gas electron configuration.
looking at the opposite corner theseelements don't want to gain electrons
they would rather lose themexceptions to this trend happen for
exactly the same reasons as theexceptions to the ionization energy
trend. lastly we want to look atelectronegativity, this is the ability of
an atom to hold electrons tightly. itwill increase this way because a smaller
atom like fluorine with more protons forits energy level or higher effective
nuclear charge will hold electrons bestagain we will disregard the noble gases
for this trend. electronegativity will beimportant in the next clip where we
learn about chemical bonds. so thetrends to remember are atomic radius
which goes this way as well asionization energy, electron affinity, and
electronegativity which all go this waylet's check comprehensionthanks for watching guys subscribe to my

हैंऑफ द चैप्टर डी एंड एफ ब्लॉक एलिमेंट्सबहुत सारे बच्चों ने मुझे बोला है कि येचैप्टर मुश्किल लगता है इन ऑर्गेनिककेमिस्ट्री है तो थोड़ी सी मुश्किल लगजाती है है ना ओ ऑर्गेनिक वर्ड जहां पर भीआ जाता है बच्चे डरने लग जाते हैं कम टू दपॉइंट इस वीडियो को हम 15 मिनट्स मेंकरेंगे 15 मिनट में जो भी इसके इंपोर्टेंटइंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट्स है वो हम देख लेंगेबहुत सारी चीजें में आपको मजा आएगा मैंकुछ क्वेश्चंस आप लोगों से पूछूंगा उम्मीदकरूंगा कि आप लोग उसका आंसर करोगे और अगरआप प्रिपेयर कर रहे हो जेई के लिए नीट केलिए देखिए बोर्ड्स क्लास 11 क्लास 12thसीटी आप इस चैनल से कर सकते हो दैट इजकेमिस्ट्री गुरुजी 2.0 और अगर आप जेई नीटके लिए प्रिपेयर कर रहे हो तो आपकोसब्सक्राइब करना चाहिए हमारा चैनल रवअकेडमी जिसका लिंक आपको डिस्क्रिप्शन मेंमिल जाएगा प्रिंट कमेंट में भी मिल जाएगाऔर इस लेक्चर में मैंने कुछ अच्छे सेनोट्स यूज किए हैं डिजिटल वाले तोको ट्रांजीशन क्यों बोलते हैं बिकॉज़ देहैव पार्शियली फीड डी ऑर्बिटल है ना कोईभी एलिमेंट जिसके पास पार्शियली फीड डीऑर्बिटल हो इन देयर ग्राउंड स्टेट और कॉमनऑक्सीडेशन स्टेट तो आप

हमारे पास है डी ऑर्बिटल है ठीकहै और इस तरह से ये स्प्लिट हो जाता हैक्रिस्टल फील्ड थ्योरी में आप सीखते हो तोय कहां से इलेक्ट्रॉन इधर से इधर चला जाताहै जैसे इसके पास एनर्जी आती है इसकोबोलते हैं डीडी ट्रांजिशन और डीडीट्रांजिशन कब पॉसिबल है जब अनपेयर्डइलेक्ट्रॉन होंगे कुछ एलिमेंट्स होते हैंजो कलर शो नहीं करते जैसे जिंक है वो कलरनहीं शो करता क्योंकि उसके पास एन पडइलेक्ट्रॉन नहीं है डीड ट्रांजीशन भीपॉसिबल नहीं है अगला प्रॉपर्टी आ जाती हैअलोय फॉर्मेशन तो डी ब्रॉक के एलिमेंट जोहै बहुत ज्यादा एलॉयज बनाते हैं है ना अबक्यों बनाते हैं बात ये है अ जैसे ये है अओके डी ब्लॉक की एक मेटल है यहां पर डीब्लॉक की दूसरी मेटल है तो इन मेटल्स काजो साइज होता है वो स्मॉल एंड सिमिलर हैअब साइज स्मल एंड सिमिलर होने से क्याहोता है कि एक मेटल के एटम दूसरे एटम केमेटल के एटम को रिप्लेस कर सकते हैं जैसेकि हमारा एक अलोय है ब्रास ब्रास किससेमिलके बनता है कॉपर से और जिंक से अब येदोनों आजूबाजू है कॉपर जिंक पासपास है तोइनका साइज सेम सेम है तो एक दूसरे केएटम्स को इजली रिप्लेस कर सकते हैं आगेमूव करते हैं इंटरस्टिशल कंपाउंड क्याहोता है भाई जैसे हमारे पास कोई डी ब्लॉककी मेटल है ये हमारे पास डी ब्लॉक की मेटलहै हैना अब जब मेटल्स के जो एटम्स होते हैं वोस्फेरिकल होते हैं अब स्फेरिकल में कुछ नाकुछ स्पेस वेकेंट रही जाता है और जब इसछोटे-छोटे स्पेस को ऑक्यूपाइडकार्बन नाइट्रोजन ऑक्सीजन इस तरह के एटमछोटे-छोटे एटम जब फॉलो कर फिल कर देते हैंतब जो हमारे पास कंपाउंड बनके आते हैंउन्हें हम लोग इंटरस्टिशल कंपाउंड बोलतेहैं इसके बाद है मैग्नेटिक प्रॉपर्टीज तोमोस्टली एलिमेंट पैराम मैग्नेटिक होते हैंऔर पैराम मैग्नेटिक क्यों होते हैं ड्यूटू द प्रेजेंस ऑफ अनपेयर्ड इलेक्ट्रॉन हैना और पैरामैट्टामूवमेंट निकालनी होती है किसी

जोकि चैप्टर की इंपोर्टेंट डेफिनेशन हैइंपोर्टेंट एक्सेप्शन है इंपोर्टेंटफार्मूला है वो सब अच्छे से हो जाएंगे औरआप इस छोट छोट के बाद अपने आप को चेक करपाओगे कि आप स्टैंड कहां पर करते हो है नाइसमें आपने इससे मैंने कुछ क्वेश्चन पूछेहैं मैं चाहूंगा आप उनके आंसर करो और चारपांच क्वेश्चन अगर आप सारे क्वेश्चंस केआंसर सही से कर देते हो तो आप मान सकते होकि यस आपको ये चैप्टर आता है इस लेक्चर केनोट्स आपको मिल जाएंगे t ग्रा चैनल जो किभारत पंचाल सर के नाम से है और अगर आप परहो तो आपको कनेक्ट करना चाहिए भारत पचा 92मेराये अपनी आइडेंटिटी को लूज नहीं करेंगेअपनी आइडेंटिटी को बनाए रखेंगे प्रॉपरबिल्कुल पूरी तरह से आ इसमें डिसोसिएटनहीं होते हैं अगर मैं डबल सोल्ड केएग्जांपल की बात करूं जैसे पोटाश आलम हैk2s o4 al2और ये लोन पेयर ऑफ इलेक्ट्रॉन को क्योंलेते हैं क्योंकि इनका न्यूक्लियर चार्जहाई होता है हाई न्यूक्लियर चार्ज होता हैइसके अलावा इनके पास वैक एट डी ऑर्बिटलहोता है जिससे इलेक्ट्रॉन को अट्रैक्टकरते हैं और अपने पास ले सकते हैं आगेबढ़ते हैं नेक्स्ट तो कई सारी थ्योरी हैऔर सबसे पहले थ्योरी आती है वर्नर थ्योरीवर्नर थ्योरी हमें क्या बताती है कि किसीभी कोऑर्डिनेशन क पाउंड के अंदर जो मेटलहोती है वो दो तरह की वैलेंसी शो करती हैएक होती है प्राइमरी वैलेंसी एक होती हैसेकेंडरी वैलेंसी जो प्राइमरी वैलेंसीहोती है वो आयनिक होती है यहां पर न नॉनडायरेक्शनल होती है आयनिक है तो वेरी नाइसनॉन ये क्या होगी हमारे पास नॉनडायरेक्शनल होगी आयनाइजेबल होगी एंड इक्वलहोती है किसके ऑक्सीडेशन स्टेट के अगर आपकहीं पर भी ऑक्सीडेशन स्टेट निकाल ते होतो वो उसकी प्राइमरी वैलेंसी कह लाएगीसेकेंडरी वैलेंसी क्या होती है डायरेक्शनलहोती है नॉन आयनाइजेबल होती है और येकिसके इक्वल होती है कोऑर्डिनेशन नंबरइसकी एक सिंपल सी ट्रिक बना

स्टेबल हुआ तो इसकाहाइड्रोजन फास्ट हो जाएगा इसके बादनेक्स्ट हमारे पास आता है कि अगर मानलीजिए आपके पास इस तरह से तीन डबल बॉन्डहै एक सिस्टम में लेकिन आपको सिर्फ एक हीआपके पास सिर्फ एक हाइड्रोजन मॉलिक्यूल

Video script in this video we're going to focus onthe functional groupsso this is the first functional group weneed to be familiar with and thisis an alkanean alkane is in hydrocarbon that onlycontainsingle carbon hydrogen bonds it doesn'thave any double bonds or triple bondsjust all single bondsthis particular alkaneis known as pentanebecause it has five carbons onetwothree fourfiveremembermethanehas one carbon so this is methaneethane has two carbonspropane has threebutane has fourpentanehas fivehexane has sixheptanehas seven carbons octane has eight ninehas nine and decane has tennow what functional group is representedby this moleculeso this particular moleculeis known as an alkene that's thefunctional groupso any time you see a carbon-carbondouble bondit has an alkenefunctional groupnow this particular alkene has fourcarbonsand the double bond is between carbonstwo and threeso you pick the smaller of the twonumbersand so you call it twobutanenow what about this examplewhat if we have a carbon-carbon triplebondin this case this is known as an alkyneso that's the functional group and theparticular name for this moleculeis twobutaneit has the suffix ironnow if you want to draw the linestructurefor that molecule looks like thisand so this four carbons this is carbonone two three and fournow what functional group is representedbythese moleculesthese are known ascycloalkanesit's an alkane becauseit only has single bondsand it's cyclic it forms a ring-like orcircular structurenow the first oneis known ascyclopentanebecause as you can see there's fivecarbonsand the second onehassix carbonsand so it's calledcyclohexanenow what about this onelet's say if we have a cyclic structurewith alternating double bondswhat functional group do we have herethis is known as an aromatic ringnow this particular aromatic ringhas a special name called benzeneand so you'll see this a lotin a typical organic chemistry coursenow what about this onewhat if you see a halogen attachtoa hydrocarbon what's the name for itso the functional group for thismolecule is known asan alkylhalidenow you can also call it a halo alkanethat's another way to describe itand so it has the functional group rxwhere ris the hydrocarbon chainand x is the halogen it could bechlorinex could bebromine as we saw in this example itcould be fluorineor iodineso that's an alkyl halideso next upwe havean etheran ether is basically an oxygenattached to two r groupsthe r groups can be methyl groups ethylgroups and so forth so we have twomethyl groups attached to this etherso it's calleddimethyletherethers are polardue to the oxygenandas long as you don't have too manyhydrocarbons attached to it if thehydrocarbon chain is not so big it'sgoing to be a relatively polar moleculenow what about this onewhat type of functional groupdo we have hereso if you seean o h group attached to an r group thisis known as an alcoholso for this example we have four carbonsand the o h group is on carbon one sothis is calledonebutanolfor the second examplethe o h groupis on carbon twoso that's going to be called2butanolso if you see an oh group attached to ahydrocarbon chainit's an alcoholso what about thismolecule what type of functional groupdoes it representand let's compare itto this oneso the first one has the generic formularcoand thensome other r groupif you see that this is a ketonethe oxygen looks like thisnow this particular ketonehas five carbon atomsandthis is known as a carb a carbonyl grouplet me say that carefullyso that ketone is called twopentanoneon the bottomwe have an aldehydeand if you see this rc chothat's the functional group foran aldehydeand this is for ketoneso this particular aldehydehas a totalof six carbon atomsand the aldehyde functional group willalways be at the endso you don't need to attach a number toitso this is simplyhexanalso instead of a olyou can see it has the suffixalso that's an aldehydeso make sure you could distinguish analdehyde from a ketoneand aldehyde has the carbonyl functionalgroup at the end of the chain a ketonehas the carbonyl groupsomewhere in the middle of the chain andthat distinguishes the twonow for those of you whomight be studying for the organicchemistry final exami have a video that can help youand it's on my patreon page if you go topatreon.com slashmath science tutor you can access thatpageif you scroll downthere's a lot of other videos i havehere too butlet's say if you're takingthe first semester of organic chemistryi have a six hour video that can helpyou with that if you decide to become apatronnowon youtube i have a free two hourtrailer version of this video but if youwant the entire six hour video you canaccess it here or on vimeo as welland for those of you who are takingthe second semester of organic chemistryi have an eight hour video that you canaccess as welland there's some other stuff here thatyou could find tooif you're taking gen chem or physicsi have stuff on that as wellso that's it just in case you'reinterestedso what about this oner c o o h what functional group do youthinkthis representsso this is known asa carboxylic acidso that's another functional group youneed to be familiar withand in this example we have atotal of six carbons and so this isgoing to be calledhexanoic acidso the suffix for carboxylic acid is oaknow what about this one what functionalgroupis representedby this moleculeso if you see r c o or what functional group do we have hereso this is represented bysomething called an esternow to name itthis portion herethis is the ethanol weight partthat includes the carbon with the twooxygensand so it's ethanoate because there'stwo carbons hereandthe right side has a methyl groupso when you name it you need to put itneeds to name this one firstso it's methylethno8and so that's how you can name an esterso the 08 partcomes lastnow the next functional group we need togo overis an amineand so the amine has an nh2 group at theend it has hydrogen bondinglike an alcohol or a carboxylic acidand let me give you some examplesso this is known asmethylaminethat's the common name for itand herewhat do you think this is called what'sthe common name forch3 ch2 nh2so we have an ethyl groupattached to an amine functional group soyou can call this ethylamineand so the common names are verystraightforwardnow what if there's a carbonyl groupattached to an nh2 groupwhat is the functional group called soyou can write this as rco and h2 if you see thatit's the same as what you see aboveso this is known asan amideor in a bindnow this particular groupwell let's use an example to name ithow can we namethis moleculeso we have a total of four carbon atomsand so to name it this is going to bebutanomideso instead of saying butane take off thee and add amide at the endthe next one is a nitrileso if you seea triple bond between a carbon and anitrogen atomyou havea nitrilefunctional grouphere's a good example of onech3ctriple bond nso we have a total of two carbon atomsand so this is going to be calledethane nitrileso here's the next functional groupwhat functional group do we have hereif you see this this is known asan acidanhydridethe common name for this molecule isknown as aceticanhydride when you see the word aceticit's similar to ethyl it has two carbonsnext up is an acidchloridethis is also known asacetylchloridenow you can have a different halogenattached to it for instancewe could havea bromine atom attached to it and sothis would be calledan[Music]acid bromide insteadoracetyl bromidenow what about this example let's say ifwe havean sh groupand how is it similar toan oh groupnow we know if we have an oh group it'san alcoholbut what if we have an sh groupand this is calleda thiolnow what do you think these areanytime you hear or if you see a sulfurattached tolet's say a hydrocarbonthe word thiowill be presentso here's some other exampleson the rightthis is known as an etherso what do you think the functionalgroup on the left is going to be calledthis is known asa thioethernow on the right at the bottomthisis calledan esteron the leftthis is known asa thioesterso see the similarities alcoholthioletherthio etherand here we have esterand then thioesterso if you see an oxygen being replacedwith a sulfur atomadd the prefix thio to itthe name is going to have some sort ofthio on itso what about this functional groupso what if we have an alcoholand an alkene next to each otherso this is going to be called an enolthink of the wordinfor alkeneand allfor alcoholso if you see those two togetherthis is called an enolso here's another onelet's say it is a nitrogen with two rgroupsandit's next to a double bondso a carbon with a nitrogen that's aan amineand a double bondis an alkene so if we combine these twowe get something calledan enamine or enamineand so that's the functional group thatcorrespondsto this moleculenow if you seea carbon double bonded to a nitrogenatomthis is known as an immunenow there's a few more examples i wantto go overwhat do you think this is calledhave you ever seen this molecule beforein other words h2o2h2o2 is hydrogen peroxidewhat we have hereisan organic peroxideso if you see two oxygens attached toeach otherit's a peroxideif they're attached to each otherthrough a single bondnow what do you think this is calledand let me compare it to this moleculeso this molecule here you knowis a carboxylic acidand here we have a peroxideso what do you thinkthis entire molecule is calledthis is known asa peroxy acid very similar toa carboxylic acid with a peroxidefunctional group so when you combine ityou get a peroxy acidand we're going to go over one moregroupyou might see this butyou may notor you may see an orgo too this is knownas a nitro groupyou might not see this norgo one butit's definitely in organic chem 2.so i'm going to stop here there's someother functional groups to note butthese aresome very common ones actually there aresome other ones you need to knowi wouldn't really consider themfunctional groups butyou need to know the names of it so thisis calleda carbocationand if you have let's sayan odd number of electronsthis is known asa radicaland this isa carb anionand this species is neutral but if yousee it it's calleda carbine so i'm going to stop hereso that's it for this video thanks forwatching

Video script [Music]Jupiter played a crucial role indeveloping life on Earth thank youJupiter we normally just see the verytop layer atmosphere there are so manysecrets of Jupiter contained below theseclouds so I'm currently analyzing datafrom the juniorspacecraft Juno the spacecraft has allthese magical instruments to see insideof JupiterJupiter is the most extreme environmentNASA's evervisited to send a spacecraft there is alittle bit insane this is one of thelargest spacecraft ever made we had toyou know build an armored tank to go[Music]there Jupiter's radiation environment isthe most dangerous environment for aspacecraft to go into it's a region wewere very afraid of because no one hadever been therebefore if that doesn't fire just rightyou fly right past Jupiter that's it youdon't go into orbit you go around thesolar system Again by the time you comeback to Jupiter it's decades lateralmost there it's a very uncomfortable[Music][Applause]situation welcome to Jupiter we just didthe hardest thing NASA's ever done[Music]what we actually found blew our[Music]minds when you first look at jupter whatreally catches your eye is the Great RedSpot it's this gigantic storm in thesouthern hemisphere of Jupiter is largerthan theearth it has been around for over 200years and it's absolutely incrediblethen you begin to look further away andyou see these belts and SS moving indifferent directions on the planet andeverywhere you look you basically see astorm and what drives these storms welllikely Jupiter is collapsing very veryslowly this is energy left from itsformation and this energy is releasedand it's that energy that churns theatmosphere so violently all the timethis is is in contrast to Earth whereour weather is governed by the[Music]Sun a lot of tourists go to NorthernSweden and Scandinavia to see theNorthern Lights of the earth if you wantreally want to show and something that'son all the time as you go to Jupiter andsee Jupiter's aora is brighter than allthe energy that all the power plants onEarth can produce and is actually fueledby a volcano so Jupiter has this mooncalled called IO and that's fiercelyvolcanic spewing out material nearJupiter all the time about ton a secondthe material this material gets trappedby the magnetic field this energyfunnels down impacting the planet andthat's the Aurora we[Music]see what we find is vortices kind oflike hurricanes they're all packedtogetherand we've been watching them now for ayear and they haven't all merged intoone they're packed in in this pentagonalpattern there's actually six of them ifyou count the one in the center and theyjust sort of sit there and this isremarkable this is really the first timeuh that anyone has seen such a geometricpattern of cyclones on any planet oranywhere I look at an image like thatand I say wow the idea that nature canmake such a geometrical structure is[Music]fascinating we've known since theVoyager emissions that lightning existsin the Clouds OfJupiter what Juno found is there's asecond form of lightning at Jupiter thisis the signal from the microwaveradiometer and it's uh measuring theheat of the planet and uh every now andthen we get a spike bamit became very clear very soon that thiswas radio signals from the lightning inJupiter's atmosphere maybe a thousandtimes brighter than the lightning onEarth the presence of of lightning atJupiter hints at vast amount of waterand junus actually confirmed that in thelower part of the atmosphere one out of400 molecules is a water molecule that'sa lot of water does that mean mean thatthere's life in jupitus atmosphere wellultimately we don't know we have a thisnotion on what life is based on ourexperience here on Earth can wetranslate that to Jupiter can there belife forms floating about in theatmosphere we don't reallyknow Jupiter is so massive about 300times more heavythan the earth with all thisgravitational power comes hugeresponsibilities Jupiter originallyflung water into the inner solar systemcreating the conditions for life atEarth so thank you Jupiter it alsolikely altered the orbit of anasteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65million years ago Jupiter's presencegravitational presence is absolutelyeverywherethis is the outline of Jupiter andbasically what we're seeing there arejust the cloud tops but what we want toknow is what's inside Jupiter beforeJuno we believe that Jupiter would had areally small core under which gas juststuck by gravitational forces what Junohas found is actually that jupit has gota really big core there's somethingdenser it's probably like 5 10 Earthmasses it's mostly made of rocks at veryhigh pressures and temperatures so thatshows that Jupiter started its life as arocky icy world and that it capture thegas that was around the hydrogen andhelium and that formed a giant planetthat's Jupiternow I first became interested in Jupiterwhen I was at College in Sweden wasthere was a telescope on the roof andone night we got got to see Jupiter withher own eyes and it was absolutelyextraordinary a whole different worldthat I can see right there in the nightsky what would he think about me today Ithink he'd be proud ecstaticit has the biggest volcanic plumes thatwe know of with exotic sulfurouscompositions the highest temperaturelavas that we've detected it's as hot as1800°Kelvin so IO wins lots of awards forbeingextreme some of us love IO just for itsown sake but it's also a a laboratoryfor understanding other planetsespecially the the terrestrial planetvery early in their history when theywere hotter they had more heat this wasa time when when life first formed whenPL tectonics was getting going with within many ways studying very early Earthit's like studying anotherplanet understanding IO might teach ussomethingfundamental like to understand that typeof volcanic eruption without having onehappen on Earth today that would beunfortunate for all of us living here IOthat's happening today very High fusiongenate volcanism more active than themost active volcanoes we usually have onEarth and it changes our whole view ofhow planetswork for terrestrial planets like theEarth and Moon our thinking is is thatit's kind of like the life time of ahuman being when you're young you'reenergetic and active and then you getmore quiescent and more and morequiescent then you die boring well theseouter planet satellites are much morelike the Hindu life cycle where you canbe reborn and and go through all sortsof cycles of activity so very differentconcept of how planetswork we have no shortage at all of ofunanswered questions and Mysteries uhthroughout the solar system andbeyond right IO is um a little bitlarger than Earth'smoon it's one of four large moons ofJupiter it's the innermost of the fourmoons and three of these moons are in aa resonance so every time ganam orbitsJupiter once Europa orbits twice and IOorbits four times this means that thatthe distance to massive Jupiter isvarying and the whole Moon changes itsshape where the surface of the MoonRises and sinks as much as 100 meters incase of IO every 42 hours that changingof shape it's like bending a piece ofmetal back and forth it Heats it upso we've proposed the ioa volcanoobserver in the Discovery program that'sNASA's lowcost category of planetaryMission but uh this Mission would make10 Close flybys of IO while orbiting uhJupiter has a suite ofinstruments and the tour is designed sothat we fly by Iowa just the right timesand placesin order to measure the the titlegravity signature we have to have pairsof identical flybys one when iio isclosest to Jupiter and one that'sotherwise identical but when IO isfurthest from Jupiter so it sees thesame signal except that dis differencein range to to Jupiter which changes theshape of of IO that'll tell us reallywhat's going on inside IO does it reallyhave a magma ocean and even if it has amagma ocean what type of magma oceanthat's really I think the mostfundamental thing that we need to get aspacecraft that makes close flybys of ofIO at a minimum landing on iO andorbiting IO would be even better youhave to understandthough IO is deep within the intenseradiation of of Jupiter so Jupiter has avery powerful magnetosphere so it's avery high radiation environment it'svery tough on electronicsso you know we're not going to explore Ithe way we have Mars with these longlift Rovers on the surface unless wehave a revolution in in electronics andhow it how to withstand the radiation umso fast flybys is is the way around thatfor now uh get get in there close get abunch of data and get out of thatradiation as fast as youcan there are volcanic plumes up toseveral hundred kilometers high veryspectacular and and uh that some of thatmaterial maybe directly Escape aisle but also thathigh radiation environment and thoseenergetic particles interact and stripoff material if we're so close thatwe're in flying through a a lavafountain that would obviously be bad fora spacecraft uh we hope to fly throughthe upper parts of plumes where it'sit's mostly gas and very small particlesthat that are not hazardous uh course ifyou make a math error and impact IO thatwould not be good unless it wasintentional to dispose of the spacecraftat the end of the mission and that ishow we would plan to to end it all afterthe the mission isover it would mean a great deal to me tosee this mission go forward now I'm I'mnot going to be the one leading themission at iio you know it has to be theNext Generation you have to think interms of multi-generations when you'redealing with the outer solar system andespecially when you have to spend adecade just just to get the missionapproved so for me though that's allfine uh I get it started and then Ienjoy life and enjoy watching uh otherscarryon and I have no doubt that I willsurprise us it's it's it's a verysurprising place and it's surprisedevery Mission that's ever looked at itthe conventional thinking is thatthere's no way there's life on iO it'stoo hot well it's only hot over 1% ofthe surface uh there are certainlyplaces with with better temperaturesit's also thought that there's no waterwell we haven't detectedwater but we didn't think there waswater on the moon either for a long timeuntil we got better measurements so wemight be surprised about that and alsowhat kind of Life are we talking aboutthe only thing we we know how to talkabout is Life as we know it which iscarbon and water-based life so if it'ssome other kind of life then who knowsall bets are off so it's the surprisesthat will be the the most fun and mostsignificant this is one of the fewplaces in our solar system where we havea good chance to look forlife there's evidence for a vastsubsurface ocean below the ice crust ofthe Moon the amount of water thatsuspected there is many times more thanall oceans together we have on Earth onthe PO you're approaching minus 200° Cicicles that could be several M Highmight bepresent and if you're very lucky thenyou might just spot a plume eruptingnearby like an ice volcano that thatejects material from the subsurface toenormousaltitudes um on top of that there's uhgood chance that there's an energysource at the bottom of the oceanhydrothermal activity that can supportthe emergence of life that makes uhEuropaoutstanding Europa Clipper is the firstmission that goes to the outer solarsystem that has the exclusive goal toinvestigate the habitability of the bodyin the outer solar system it will launchin October 24 and will arrive at Jupiterin April 2030 so it's 5 and a half yearsfor Europa Clipper Jupiter has likeabout 70 moons so the number increaseslike every every year by a bit but thereare four moons that stand out that arethe so-called Galilean moons theinnermost is IO then Europa then ganidand thenKalisto with the telescopic observationsbefore the arrival of the firstspacecraft you could see that some ofthese moons are really really brightthey reflect way more light than a rockysurface would and so for example Europaand also Enceladus they are one of thebrightest uh objects and so it was ectedalready at that time that the surfacemight be composed of shiny reflectingwater I I mean after the investigationsof the uh Galileo spacecraft in the late90s Europa became a prime target inplanetary science um all over the solarsystem because with a huge subsurfaceocean with the spectro tidal thermalactivity that became the first placethat could be habitable in our solarsystem uh besides maybe Mars thatimmediately sparked proposals ofmissions to go back to Jupiter andspecifically investigate Europa I meanif you are a planetary scientistprobably the most rewarding science goalis to see if a planetary body ishabitable or actuallyinhabited so Europa Clipper will stay inorbit around Jupiter and in most of itsrevolutions it will have a close flybyat Europa um and the flybys are arrangedin a way that it's like a web in the endsurrounding the Moon that you have inthe end a good overview over uh almostthe entire Surface after these 50flybys during this Clos flybys you youget uh an idea of what is uh evaporatingfrom the surface of Europa and from thatof course you learn uh about the makeupthe composition of the surface and thisis of course specifically true ifthere's plume and vanting activitythat's what I really would put a smilein my face if we could measure Plummaterial um that's connected to thesubsurface ocean ofEuropa the instrument called suda thesurface dust analyzer is the instrumentI'm working on it measures thecomposition of tiny grains that aresurrounding Europa mostly ice grains andthese grains are um knocked off theSurface by microm meteroid impacts withthe Puda instrument we can sample thesematerials and with that we get an ideaabout the surface composition we couldconstrain what Souls were there in theocean uh what the if there's an alkalineneutral or basic environment if there'shydrothermal activity at the bottom ofthe ocean what the organic chemistry uhinside the oceanhas evolved to unfortunately wecurrently only have one example of aplanetary body or Moon where life existsand so it's very difficult to speculateabout the nature of life elsewhere if welook for signs of Life on an icy moonlike Europa it probably the moststraightforward to just look for simpleforms of life if there would be complexcivilizations um in these subsurfaceoceans we probably would have known bynowright but I know that um at least forthe life on Earth the access to oxygenis important to develop complex lifecompared to simple monocellular life soum this is one of the big sciencequestion that Europa Clipper wants toanswer has Europa ocean access to oxygenthat is created on the surface so ismaterial from the surface cycling backdown to the ocean if yes then oxygenmight be available in the ocean and thisopens up the possibility for morecomplex life not just a single cell butmaybe fish like uh complex lifeeverything between uh one cell or nolife or fish-like life like complexorganisms that might be even intelligentor not nobody knows it's really up inthe air I look very much forward to thelaunch it will be launched on Falconheavy that was decided only a few monthsago so one of Elon musk's rockets andI'm very much looking forward because Inever saw a rocket launch in my life Ilike to see it but on the other handit'll make me nervous so if the that'salways a problem if if Rockets have achance even the safest Rockets have achance of like a one % or2% that there's some failure and uh theneverything was in vain because all thedevelopment has been done mostinstruments have been crafted twice thatyou have a spare so I really hope thatthe launch will go well so I think it'sone of the most exciting missions thereis and I'm really glad that I canparticipate uh in thisEndeavors the Northern Lights on Jupiterare the most spectacular in our solarsystemthey're stunning and they're bigger thanour entireplanet they produce incredibly powerfulflares that reach terawatts of powerthat's more energy than you'd need tobriefly supply all of humancivilization what causes them why dothey seem to pulse likeclockwork to truly unlock Jupiter'sMysteries we needed a way to get closerto it than everbefore Jupiter is the most extremeenvironment NASA's evervisited to send a spacecraft there is alittle bitinsane we had to you know build anarmored tank to go there Juno arrived inJupiter's orbit in2016 as it got closer the auroras onJupiter became so dramatic and activethat astronomers said it was likeJupiter was putting on a fireworksdisplay for Juno's arrival which seemsapt given the sheer scale of thespacecraft behind me is the Junospacecraft basically life size it's anenormousspacecraft close to 70 ft in diameter asit spins around and cartwheels throughspace this is one of the largestspacecraft evermade Juno showed us more than we'd everseen of Jupiter's auroras as theyrippled over the planetpoles the Northern Lights on Earth arecaused by solar winds entering ouratmosphere and interacting with theplanet's magneticfield Jupiter's magnetic field alsoknown as the magnetosphere is 20,000times stronger than the one here onEarth it extends all the way back toSaturn and perhapsfurther and it's the biggest structurein the solar system next to the sun's MIosphere that's one of the reasonsJupiter's auroras are so huge thesegigantic magnetic tentacles captureparticles from across the solar systemthrusting them towards the planet'spoles creating this epic light show thatnever dies but this is only part of thestory as well as photographing Jupiter'sdazzling displays Juno also beganmapping Jupiter's core and that's whenthings got interestingJupiter is a gas giant it is full ofloads of gas especially hydrogen andhelium and when hydrogen is underextreme pressure it acts in a reallyweird way it becomes liquid metal liquidmetal like the at the core of Jupiter isan ocean of liquid metallic hydrogenand using some of Juno's findingsphysicists in California tried torecreate this extraordinary phenomenonbubbling away deep inside Jupiter's coreso basically we're creating a littleplanet interior inside our laboratoryMarius moo and his team at the nationalignition facility conducted a prettycrazy experiment they fired lasers at atiny Target which imitates the core ofJupiter the lasers simulate theunfathomable pressures going oninside so this is the Target that we putinside this uh Target chamber we fill alittle portion inside this cone herewith liquid hydrogen about 20 million ofa gram and then we shine 80 laser beamsfrom the top and 80 laser beam from thebottom so the power that we put in thelasers when we shine the laser onto thetarget is about 500 times the power thatis used for the entire United States ata givenmoment 5 4 3 2 1shot through the laser blast the teamobserved this surreal change that takesplace in the core of Jupiter at thistime the pressure got so high that thelight is now reflecting off the shinysurface of the hydrogen hydrogentransformed from being transparent toopaque and then becomes a metal like ashiny metal if we were to go deep insideJupiter we would see a deep ocean offluid shiny metal and just like that theplanet completely messed with what'spossible with the elements it throws outthe rule book on Jupiter this metallichydrogen makes up to potentially 50% ofthe planet's mass and it's this hugeliquid metal ocean that accounts forJupiter's gigantic magnetic field butthat's not all it also causes chargedparticles to leak out at its extremitiesand it's this that causes thebreathtaking auroras that outshine allthe others in the solarsystem so Jupiter's core is the mainsource of the auroras but its moons alsowanted to get in on the ACT particularlyone of the strangest moons in the solarsystem IO this moon is the mostvolcanically active in the solar systemits spectacular volcanoes spew plumes upto 300 miles into the atmosphere addingextra fuel to Jupiter's light show so wesee Jupiter in the middle but aroundJupiter we see the moons eio EuropaganamKalisto the gases that come from eiobecome trapped in the magneticfield and they become accelerated tovery high energies these trapped chargedparticles get dragged towards Jupiter'spoles by its all-encompassing Magnetospere energetic charge particles come inbombard the atmosphere make itGlow and then we're seeing this glow inthe atmosphere of Jupiter so thecombination of the giganticmagnetosphere it's supercharged liquidmetal core and unique moons create thesebreathtakingauror but astrophysicists were stillpuzzled by one thing why do these aurorlight up and Flash in semi regularpatterns pulsing in this extremelybizarre way it took a team at UCL tocrack the case in the time they watchedthe auroras they found that they pulsedevery 27 minutes by closely analyzingthe data sent back from Juno and theEuropean Space Agency telescope xmmNewton they came to the conclusion thatperiodic vibrations crashed across themagnetosphere causing waves of plasma tosend heavy ion particles surface acrossthe magnetic field toward Jupiter butthe mystery isn't over just what causesthese vibrations what determines thepattern of these pulses and why doesJupiter randomly decide on theserhythmic regular intervals this is justthe beginning of our learning aboutJupiter's auroras and that's just thestart of a wider search there are morelike them across the Galaxy waiting tobeexplored as the young Jupiter circlesthe sun it clears a path through the gascloud that envelops the early solarsystem but that process causes it to dosomethingalarming Jupiter begins to spiralinwardsplowing straight through the region ofspace that would become the asteroidbelt when the young Jupiter movesthrough the primordial asteroid beltthings get scattered around things getgravitationally deflected and as aconsequence of all of this gravitationalinteraction more than 99% of theoriginal mass that was there isbasically now gonethe asteroid belt has been disruptedover time by the movement of the giantplanets and this has acted to throwmaterial from the asteroid belt out ofthe asteroid belt into the outer solarsystem these protoplanetary cores likeseries were never able to graduate tofull-fledged planets because there wasjust not enough material in the orbitalneighborhood[Music]when Jupiter passed through theprimordial asteroid belt it starvedseries of material halting itsgrowth and the dwarf planet wascondemned to live out its life as a coldBarren Rockbut siries isn't the only World in oursolar system whose development was cutshort Mars would suffer a similar fateat the hands ofJupiter after marauding through whatwould become the asteroid beltJupiter enters the region of space whereMars isforming continuing its Journey spiralingtowards theSun as Jupiter bulldozes inwardsits immense gravity scatters material inalldirections some is sent careering intothe sunand some is thrown out into Interstellarspace it is because of the gravitationalclearing of this neighborhood by Jupiterthat Mars was unable to grow to morethan 10% of that of the Earth this iswhy Mars is smalland by clearing material out of theinner solarsystem the giant planet may also haveprevented the formation of the superEarths we see in othersystems and if it had continued movinginward our planet too might never haveformed but then just as it looks likeJupiter will sweep everythingaway the giant planet stops in itstracks because in the shadows of theouter solarsystem another planet isforming the Solar System's second gasgiant[Music]Saturn and its arrival changeseverything as Jupiter moved inwardsSaturn moved inwards and caught up toJupiter's orbit when this happened thetwo locked into a special configurationknown as a mean motion resonance this iswhere the planets begin to interactgravitationally in a very coherentManner and now locked as a unit the tworeversed their migration course andmoved backoutSaturn caused Jupiter to[Music]retreat leaving behind just enoughmaterial from which the inner planetscouldform MercuryVenus and ourhome Earth is in exactly the rightlocation to provide the environment forlife to develop so if Jupiter had movedaround even more who knows maybe lifenever would have done developed in thesolar system as we knowit and as its voyage across the solarsystem draws to aclose Jupiter helps to provide ourliving world with its most precious[Music]ingredient today 2/3 of our planetsurface is covered by oceanmore than 1.3 billion cubic km of[Music]water each drop teaming withlife one of the big questions about theevolution of our solar system is how didwe get water here on this planet so wethink that the inner planets didn'tnaturally form with a lot of water wateris Prim in the outer solarsystem but if you end up having Jupiterand Saturn moving outwards then that isable to suddenly deliver more water intothe inner solarsystem locked in a gravitational dancewithSaturn Jupiter moves back through theasteroidbelt and as it does so water Richmaterial is flung inwardwhere it is incorporated into thegrowing terrestrialworlds so the movement of the giantplanets have actually played animportant role in the delivery of waterto the inner solarsystem in a sense it is Jupiter'soutwards motion through the asteroidbelt that we have to thank for thedelivery of water to the surface of theEarth the Earth would be quite adifferent planet if not for Jupiter'sprimordial d ni

Video script [Music]Jupiter played a crucial role indeveloping life on Earth thank youJupiter we normally just see the verytop layer atmosphere there are so manysecrets of Jupiter contained below theseclouds so I'm currently analyzing datafrom the juniorspacecraft Juno the spacecraft has allthese magical instruments to see insideof JupiterJupiter is the most extreme environmentNASA's evervisited to send a spacecraft there is alittle bit insane this is one of thelargest spacecraft ever made we had toyou know build an armored tank to go[Music]there Jupiter's radiation environment isthe most dangerous environment for aspacecraft to go into it's a region wewere very afraid of because no one hadever been therebefore if that doesn't fire just rightyou fly right past Jupiter that's it youdon't go into orbit you go around thesolar system Again by the time you comeback to Jupiter it's decades lateralmost there it's a very uncomfortable[Music][Applause]situation welcome to Jupiter we just didthe hardest thing NASA's ever done[Music]what we actually found blew our[Music]minds when you first look at jupter whatreally catches your eye is the Great RedSpot it's this gigantic storm in thesouthern hemisphere of Jupiter is largerthan theearth it has been around for over 200years and it's absolutely incrediblethen you begin to look further away andyou see these belts and SS moving indifferent directions on the planet andeverywhere you look you basically see astorm and what drives these storms welllikely Jupiter is collapsing very veryslowly this is energy left from itsformation and this energy is releasedand it's that energy that churns theatmosphere so violently all the timethis is is in contrast to Earth whereour weather is governed by the[Music]Sun a lot of tourists go to NorthernSweden and Scandinavia to see theNorthern Lights of the earth if you wantreally want to show and something that'son all the time as you go to Jupiter andsee Jupiter's aora is brighter than allthe energy that all the power plants onEarth can produce and is actually fueledby a volcano so Jupiter has this mooncalled called IO and that's fiercelyvolcanic spewing out material nearJupiter all the time about ton a secondthe material this material gets trappedby the magnetic field this energyfunnels down impacting the planet andthat's the Aurora we[Music]see what we find is vortices kind oflike hurricanes they're all packedtogetherand we've been watching them now for ayear and they haven't all merged intoone they're packed in in this pentagonalpattern there's actually six of them ifyou count the one in the center and theyjust sort of sit there and this isremarkable this is really the first timeuh that anyone has seen such a geometricpattern of cyclones on any planet oranywhere I look at an image like thatand I say wow the idea that nature canmake such a geometrical structure is[Music]fascinating we've known since theVoyager emissions that lightning existsin the Clouds OfJupiter what Juno found is there's asecond form of lightning at Jupiter thisis the signal from the microwaveradiometer and it's uh measuring theheat of the planet and uh every now andthen we get a spike bamit became very clear very soon that thiswas radio signals from the lightning inJupiter's atmosphere maybe a thousandtimes brighter than the lightning onEarth the presence of of lightning atJupiter hints at vast amount of waterand junus actually confirmed that in thelower part of the atmosphere one out of400 molecules is a water molecule that'sa lot of water does that mean mean thatthere's life in jupitus atmosphere wellultimately we don't know we have a thisnotion on what life is based on ourexperience here on Earth can wetranslate that to Jupiter can there belife forms floating about in theatmosphere we don't reallyknow Jupiter is so massive about 300times more heavythan the earth with all thisgravitational power comes hugeresponsibilities Jupiter originallyflung water into the inner solar systemcreating the conditions for life atEarth so thank you Jupiter it alsolikely altered the orbit of anasteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65million years ago Jupiter's presencegravitational presence is absolutelyeverywherethis is the outline of Jupiter andbasically what we're seeing there arejust the cloud tops but what we want toknow is what's inside Jupiter beforeJuno we believe that Jupiter would had areally small core under which gas juststuck by gravitational forces what Junohas found is actually that jupit has gota really big core there's somethingdenser it's probably like 5 10 Earthmasses it's mostly made of rocks at veryhigh pressures and temperatures so thatshows that Jupiter started its life as arocky icy world and that it capture thegas that was around the hydrogen andhelium and that formed a giant planetthat's Jupiternow I first became interested in Jupiterwhen I was at College in Sweden wasthere was a telescope on the roof andone night we got got to see Jupiter withher own eyes and it was absolutelyextraordinary a whole different worldthat I can see right there in the nightsky what would he think about me today Ithink he'd be proud ecstaticit has the biggest volcanic plumes thatwe know of with exotic sulfurouscompositions the highest temperaturelavas that we've detected it's as hot as1800°Kelvin so IO wins lots of awards forbeingextreme some of us love IO just for itsown sake but it's also a a laboratoryfor understanding other planetsespecially the the terrestrial planetvery early in their history when theywere hotter they had more heat this wasa time when when life first formed whenPL tectonics was getting going with within many ways studying very early Earthit's like studying anotherplanet understanding IO might teach ussomethingfundamental like to understand that typeof volcanic eruption without having onehappen on Earth today that would beunfortunate for all of us living here IOthat's happening today very High fusiongenate volcanism more active than themost active volcanoes we usually have onEarth and it changes our whole view ofhow planetswork for terrestrial planets like theEarth and Moon our thinking is is thatit's kind of like the life time of ahuman being when you're young you'reenergetic and active and then you getmore quiescent and more and morequiescent then you die boring well theseouter planet satellites are much morelike the Hindu life cycle where you canbe reborn and and go through all sortsof cycles of activity so very differentconcept of how planetswork we have no shortage at all of ofunanswered questions and Mysteries uhthroughout the solar system andbeyond right IO is um a little bitlarger than Earth'smoon it's one of four large moons ofJupiter it's the innermost of the fourmoons and three of these moons are in aa resonance so every time ganam orbitsJupiter once Europa orbits twice and IOorbits four times this means that thatthe distance to massive Jupiter isvarying and the whole Moon changes itsshape where the surface of the MoonRises and sinks as much as 100 meters incase of IO every 42 hours that changingof shape it's like bending a piece ofmetal back and forth it Heats it upso we've proposed the ioa volcanoobserver in the Discovery program that'sNASA's lowcost category of planetaryMission but uh this Mission would make10 Close flybys of IO while orbiting uhJupiter has a suite ofinstruments and the tour is designed sothat we fly by Iowa just the right timesand placesin order to measure the the titlegravity signature we have to have pairsof identical flybys one when iio isclosest to Jupiter and one that'sotherwise identical but when IO isfurthest from Jupiter so it sees thesame signal except that dis differencein range to to Jupiter which changes theshape of of IO that'll tell us reallywhat's going on inside IO does it reallyhave a magma ocean and even if it has amagma ocean what type of magma oceanthat's really I think the mostfundamental thing that we need to get aspacecraft that makes close flybys of ofIO at a minimum landing on iO andorbiting IO would be even better youhave to understandthough IO is deep within the intenseradiation of of Jupiter so Jupiter has avery powerful magnetosphere so it's avery high radiation environment it'svery tough on electronicsso you know we're not going to explore Ithe way we have Mars with these longlift Rovers on the surface unless wehave a revolution in in electronics andhow it how to withstand the radiation umso fast flybys is is the way around thatfor now uh get get in there close get abunch of data and get out of thatradiation as fast as youcan there are volcanic plumes up toseveral hundred kilometers high veryspectacular and and uh that some of thatmaterial maybe directly Escape aisle but also thathigh radiation environment and thoseenergetic particles interact and stripoff material if we're so close thatwe're in flying through a a lavafountain that would obviously be bad fora spacecraft uh we hope to fly throughthe upper parts of plumes where it'sit's mostly gas and very small particlesthat that are not hazardous uh course ifyou make a math error and impact IO thatwould not be good unless it wasintentional to dispose of the spacecraftat the end of the mission and that ishow we would plan to to end it all afterthe the mission isover it would mean a great deal to me tosee this mission go forward now I'm I'mnot going to be the one leading themission at iio you know it has to be theNext Generation you have to think interms of multi-generations when you'redealing with the outer solar system andespecially when you have to spend adecade just just to get the missionapproved so for me though that's allfine uh I get it started and then Ienjoy life and enjoy watching uh otherscarryon and I have no doubt that I willsurprise us it's it's it's a verysurprising place and it's surprisedevery Mission that's ever looked at itthe conventional thinking is thatthere's no way there's life on iO it'stoo hot well it's only hot over 1% ofthe surface uh there are certainlyplaces with with better temperaturesit's also thought that there's no waterwell we haven't detectedwater but we didn't think there waswater on the moon either for a long timeuntil we got better measurements so wemight be surprised about that and alsowhat kind of Life are we talking aboutthe only thing we we know how to talkabout is Life as we know it which iscarbon and water-based life so if it'ssome other kind of life then who knowsall bets are off so it's the surprisesthat will be the the most fun and mostsignificant this is one of the fewplaces in our solar system where we havea good chance to look forlife there's evidence for a vastsubsurface ocean below the ice crust ofthe Moon the amount of water thatsuspected there is many times more thanall oceans together we have on Earth onthe PO you're approaching minus 200° Cicicles that could be several M Highmight bepresent and if you're very lucky thenyou might just spot a plume eruptingnearby like an ice volcano that thatejects material from the subsurface toenormousaltitudes um on top of that there's uhgood chance that there's an energysource at the bottom of the oceanhydrothermal activity that can supportthe emergence of life that makes uhEuropaoutstanding Europa Clipper is the firstmission that goes to the outer solarsystem that has the exclusive goal toinvestigate the habitability of the bodyin the outer solar system it will launchin October 24 and will arrive at Jupiterin April 2030 so it's 5 and a half yearsfor Europa Clipper Jupiter has likeabout 70 moons so the number increaseslike every every year by a bit but thereare four moons that stand out that arethe so-called Galilean moons theinnermost is IO then Europa then ganidand thenKalisto with the telescopic observationsbefore the arrival of the firstspacecraft you could see that some ofthese moons are really really brightthey reflect way more light than a rockysurface would and so for example Europaand also Enceladus they are one of thebrightest uh objects and so it was ectedalready at that time that the surfacemight be composed of shiny reflectingwater I I mean after the investigationsof the uh Galileo spacecraft in the late90s Europa became a prime target inplanetary science um all over the solarsystem because with a huge subsurfaceocean with the spectro tidal thermalactivity that became the first placethat could be habitable in our solarsystem uh besides maybe Mars thatimmediately sparked proposals ofmissions to go back to Jupiter andspecifically investigate Europa I meanif you are a planetary scientistprobably the most rewarding science goalis to see if a planetary body ishabitable or actuallyinhabited so Europa Clipper will stay inorbit around Jupiter and in most of itsrevolutions it will have a close flybyat Europa um and the flybys are arrangedin a way that it's like a web in the endsurrounding the Moon that you have inthe end a good overview over uh almostthe entire Surface after these 50flybys during this Clos flybys you youget uh an idea of what is uh evaporatingfrom the surface of Europa and from thatof course you learn uh about the makeupthe composition of the surface and thisis of course specifically true ifthere's plume and vanting activitythat's what I really would put a smilein my face if we could measure Plummaterial um that's connected to thesubsurface ocean ofEuropa the instrument called suda thesurface dust analyzer is the instrumentI'm working on it measures thecomposition of tiny grains that aresurrounding Europa mostly ice grains andthese grains are um knocked off theSurface by microm meteroid impacts withthe Puda instrument we can sample thesematerials and with that we get an ideaabout the surface composition we couldconstrain what Souls were there in theocean uh what the if there's an alkalineneutral or basic environment if there'shydrothermal activity at the bottom ofthe ocean what the organic chemistry uhinside the oceanhas evolved to unfortunately wecurrently only have one example of aplanetary body or Moon where life existsand so it's very difficult to speculateabout the nature of life elsewhere if welook for signs of Life on an icy moonlike Europa it probably the moststraightforward to just look for simpleforms of life if there would be complexcivilizations um in these subsurfaceoceans we probably would have known bynowright but I know that um at least forthe life on Earth the access to oxygenis important to develop complex lifecompared to simple monocellular life soum this is one of the big sciencequestion that Europa Clipper wants toanswer has Europa ocean access to oxygenthat is created on the surface so ismaterial from the surface cycling backdown to the ocean if yes then oxygenmight be available in the ocean and thisopens up the possibility for morecomplex life not just a single cell butmaybe fish like uh complex lifeeverything between uh one cell or nolife or fish-like life like complexorganisms that might be even intelligentor not nobody knows it's really up inthe air I look very much forward to thelaunch it will be launched on Falconheavy that was decided only a few monthsago so one of Elon musk's rockets andI'm very much looking forward because Inever saw a rocket launch in my life Ilike to see it but on the other handit'll make me nervous so if the that'salways a problem if if Rockets have achance even the safest Rockets have achance of like a one % or2% that there's some failure and uh theneverything was in vain because all thedevelopment has been done mostinstruments have been crafted twice thatyou have a spare so I really hope thatthe launch will go well so I think it'sone of the most exciting missions thereis and I'm really glad that I canparticipate uh in thisEndeavors the Northern Lights on Jupiterare the most spectacular in our solarsystemthey're stunning and they're bigger thanour entireplanet they produce incredibly powerfulflares that reach terawatts of powerthat's more energy than you'd need tobriefly supply all of humancivilization what causes them why dothey seem to pulse likeclockwork to truly unlock Jupiter'sMysteries we needed a way to get closerto it than everbefore Jupiter is the most extremeenvironment NASA's evervisited to send a spacecraft there is alittle bitinsane we had to you know build anarmored tank to go there Juno arrived inJupiter's orbit in2016 as it got closer the auroras onJupiter became so dramatic and activethat astronomers said it was likeJupiter was putting on a fireworksdisplay for Juno's arrival which seemsapt given the sheer scale of thespacecraft behind me is the Junospacecraft basically life size it's anenormousspacecraft close to 70 ft in diameter asit spins around and cartwheels throughspace this is one of the largestspacecraft evermade Juno showed us more than we'd everseen of Jupiter's auroras as theyrippled over the planetpoles the Northern Lights on Earth arecaused by solar winds entering ouratmosphere and interacting with theplanet's magneticfield Jupiter's magnetic field alsoknown as the magnetosphere is 20,000times stronger than the one here onEarth it extends all the way back toSaturn and perhapsfurther and it's the biggest structurein the solar system next to the sun's MIosphere that's one of the reasonsJupiter's auroras are so huge thesegigantic magnetic tentacles captureparticles from across the solar systemthrusting them towards the planet'spoles creating this epic light show thatnever dies but this is only part of thestory as well as photographing Jupiter'sdazzling displays Juno also beganmapping Jupiter's core and that's whenthings got interestingJupiter is a gas giant it is full ofloads of gas especially hydrogen andhelium and when hydrogen is underextreme pressure it acts in a reallyweird way it becomes liquid metal liquidmetal like the at the core of Jupiter isan ocean of liquid metallic hydrogenand using some of Juno's findingsphysicists in California tried torecreate this extraordinary phenomenonbubbling away deep inside Jupiter's coreso basically we're creating a littleplanet interior inside our laboratoryMarius moo and his team at the nationalignition facility conducted a prettycrazy experiment they fired lasers at atiny Target which imitates the core ofJupiter the lasers simulate theunfathomable pressures going oninside so this is the Target that we putinside this uh Target chamber we fill alittle portion inside this cone herewith liquid hydrogen about 20 million ofa gram and then we shine 80 laser beamsfrom the top and 80 laser beam from thebottom so the power that we put in thelasers when we shine the laser onto thetarget is about 500 times the power thatis used for the entire United States ata givenmoment 5 4 3 2 1shot through the laser blast the teamobserved this surreal change that takesplace in the core of Jupiter at thistime the pressure got so high that thelight is now reflecting off the shinysurface of the hydrogen hydrogentransformed from being transparent toopaque and then becomes a metal like ashiny metal if we were to go deep insideJupiter we would see a deep ocean offluid shiny metal and just like that theplanet completely messed with what'spossible with the elements it throws outthe rule book on Jupiter this metallichydrogen makes up to potentially 50% ofthe planet's mass and it's this hugeliquid metal ocean that accounts forJupiter's gigantic magnetic field butthat's not all it also causes chargedparticles to leak out at its extremitiesand it's this that causes thebreathtaking auroras that outshine allthe others in the solarsystem so Jupiter's core is the mainsource of the auroras but its moons alsowanted to get in on the ACT particularlyone of the strangest moons in the solarsystem IO this moon is the mostvolcanically active in the solar systemits spectacular volcanoes spew plumes upto 300 miles into the atmosphere addingextra fuel to Jupiter's light show so wesee Jupiter in the middle but aroundJupiter we see the moons eio EuropaganamKalisto the gases that come from eiobecome trapped in the magneticfield and they become accelerated tovery high energies these trapped chargedparticles get dragged towards Jupiter'spoles by its all-encompassing Magnetospere energetic charge particles come inbombard the atmosphere make itGlow and then we're seeing this glow inthe atmosphere of Jupiter so thecombination of the giganticmagnetosphere it's supercharged liquidmetal core and unique moons create thesebreathtakingauror but astrophysicists were stillpuzzled by one thing why do these aurorlight up and Flash in semi regularpatterns pulsing in this extremelybizarre way it took a team at UCL tocrack the case in the time they watchedthe auroras they found that they pulsedevery 27 minutes by closely analyzingthe data sent back from Juno and theEuropean Space Agency telescope xmmNewton they came to the conclusion thatperiodic vibrations crashed across themagnetosphere causing waves of plasma tosend heavy ion particles surface acrossthe magnetic field toward Jupiter butthe mystery isn't over just what causesthese vibrations what determines thepattern of these pulses and why doesJupiter randomly decide on theserhythmic regular intervals this is justthe beginning of our learning aboutJupiter's auroras and that's just thestart of a wider search there are morelike them across the Galaxy waiting tobeexplored as the young Jupiter circlesthe sun it clears a path through the gascloud that envelops the early solarsystem but that process causes it to dosomethingalarming Jupiter begins to spiralinwardsplowing straight through the region ofspace that would become the asteroidbelt when the young Jupiter movesthrough the primordial asteroid beltthings get scattered around things getgravitationally deflected and as aconsequence of all of this gravitationalinteraction more than 99% of theoriginal mass that was there isbasically now gonethe asteroid belt has been disruptedover time by the movement of the giantplanets and this has acted to throwmaterial from the asteroid belt out ofthe asteroid belt into the outer solarsystem these protoplanetary cores likeseries were never able to graduate tofull-fledged planets because there wasjust not enough material in the orbitalneighborhood[Music]when Jupiter passed through theprimordial asteroid belt it starvedseries of material halting itsgrowth and the dwarf planet wascondemned to live out its life as a coldBarren Rockbut siries isn't the only World in oursolar system whose development was cutshort Mars would suffer a similar fateat the hands ofJupiter after marauding through whatwould become the asteroid beltJupiter enters the region of space whereMars isforming continuing its Journey spiralingtowards theSun as Jupiter bulldozes inwardsits immense gravity scatters material inalldirections some is sent careering intothe sunand some is thrown out into Interstellarspace it is because of the gravitationalclearing of this neighborhood by Jupiterthat Mars was unable to grow to morethan 10% of that of the Earth this iswhy Mars is smalland by clearing material out of theinner solarsystem the giant planet may also haveprevented the formation of the superEarths we see in othersystems and if it had continued movinginward our planet too might never haveformed but then just as it looks likeJupiter will sweep everythingaway the giant planet stops in itstracks because in the shadows of theouter solarsystem another planet isforming the Solar System's second gasgiant[Music]Saturn and its arrival changeseverything as Jupiter moved inwardsSaturn moved inwards and caught up toJupiter's orbit when this happened thetwo locked into a special configurationknown as a mean motion resonance this iswhere the planets begin to interactgravitationally in a very coherentManner and now locked as a unit the tworeversed their migration course andmoved backoutSaturn caused Jupiter to[Music]retreat leaving behind just enoughmaterial from which the inner planetscouldform MercuryVenus and ourhome Earth is in exactly the rightlocation to provide the environment forlife to develop so if Jupiter had movedaround even more who knows maybe lifenever would have done developed in thesolar system as we knowit and as its voyage across the solarsystem draws to aclose Jupiter helps to provide ourliving world with its most precious[Music]ingredient today 2/3 of our planetsurface is covered by oceanmore than 1.3 billion cubic km of[Music]water each drop teaming withlife one of the big questions about theevolution of our solar system is how didwe get water here on this planet so wethink that the inner planets didn'tnaturally form with a lot of water wateris Prim in the outer solarsystem but if you end up having Jupiterand Saturn moving outwards then that isable to suddenly deliver more water intothe inner solarsystem locked in a gravitational dancewithSaturn Jupiter moves back through theasteroidbelt and as it does so water Richmaterial is flung inwardwhere it is incorporated into thegrowing terrestrialworlds so the movement of the giantplanets have actually played animportant role in the delivery of waterto the inner solarsystem in a sense it is Jupiter'soutwards motion through the asteroidbelt that we have to thank for thedelivery of water to the surface of theEarth the Earth would be quite adifferent planet if not for Jupiter'sprimordial d ni

Video script okayhere we are for our first lecture forset theory and logicnow before i begin covering any materiallet me just try to impress upon youhow important this class isif you are a math major and howseriously you need to take itokay this isn't the hardestclass that you'll take but it is themost importantin this class you are going to learnhow to think mathematically andlogicallyand i'm not talking about computationbecause there will actually berelatively little computation involvedherethis class is going to teach you how tothink logicallyand how to prove and disprovestatements okay at the university wherei was the undergrad this class wascalledintroduction to advanced mathematicsbecause practically every class you takeafter thisis going to depend upon this classokay i cannot impress enoughthe importance not just of passing thisclassbut of understandingokay i taught many studentswho passed to this classbut not really well but they stillpassedand then in their senior level mathclassesi just simply can't find a word for howmuch they struggledokay this willthis will derail you if you don't learnthis stuffso i'm not trying to scare you but thenagain maybe i am a little bit i'm justtrying to impress upon you theimportanceof this material so don't justuh you know blow this off and do justenough to passif you're a math major you need to knowthis stuffbecause almost all the classes you haveleft after thisare going to be proof-based okayand the professors are going toassume rightfully so that you know howto read and construct proofsokay and they're not they're not goingto be able to teach youthis material again in the middle ofthose classes because there's there'sother material that need to be coveredin those classesso please put in the effort thissemesteryou will be very very glad that you didokayand it's not going to start off reallyhard so don'tdon't take this first few lectures andsay oh he was just trying to set us upto you know take it seriously but itactually seems pretty straightforwardbecause the thing is it's not going tostart off hard butit gets deeper as we go along okayso so don't let up on the on thatamount of attention that you're givingto this classokay all right so we're going to startoutat the beginning how about that that's agood place to start right and soi'm going to um i'm going to write downa couple words herewhich are set and element you probablyalready have used these in the past butthat's okay if you if youhaven't okay a setis a collectionof thingsokay or if you don't like the wordthings if that sounds tootoo juvenile we could say it's acollection of items if you would ratherhave thatokay and the next important word isthe itemsin the setare calledelements of the setso that's the basis those two words arethe basis of set theorythere's two parts of this class not apart one and a part two really but justtwo two things that areare melded together all the way throughwe're going to do set theory and we'realso going to do logicokay and these two words are the basisof set theory is the word set and theword elementokay all right now so a set is acollectionof items most of the time in maththose items will be numbers but theydon't have to beokay nowwhen we do a setwe use these curly brackets or braces orwhatever you wantto call themthat denotes a setokay and we write the elements insidethere usually i'm going to show youother ways to do it as well butfor right now i'm just going to writethe set ofthe first five uh integers if you don'tknow that word integeri'll define that in a minute but i'mjust going to write the numbers 1 2 3 45in this set we separate them withcommasso you know this is kind of trivial butit's very important okaynumber one sets need to havecurly brackets around them if you'regoing to write the set outand number two the elements in the setneed to be separated by commasyou don't have to write the whole setoutyou can just give it a name insteadokay like you know the the number pi wecan't write the whole number outright so what do we do we give it a namewe call it pithis is not a rule but it is a customthat if you're going to give a set anamemost people use capital letters for thenames of setsand that's so that you don't get itconfused with a variable usually we uselowercaseletters for variables uppercase lettersforsets okay so there i have a set thati've nameda and it has how many elements five ofthemnow this is super importantthe order that you write the elementsdoes not matterokay i can do this i can say that a alsoequalsthisthat's the same set okayi like to think of it like thisa set is a cardboard boxand the things that you see when youpeer into the boxare the elements okaynow if i had a cardboard boxand let's just pretend that there wasfour wooden locks in there and oneblock had a one on it and another onehad a two and a three and a four and afiveoh i said four blocks i'm in five blocksokayif i took that box and then shook it upand then peered inside it again i wouldprobably see those five woodenblocks you know in a different orderwouldn't ibut it's still the same box with thesame things in itcorrect sothat's why when you rearrange the orderof the elementsin a set it does not actually change thesetokay easy way to remember that is peoplesayorder doesn't matter when you're writingout a setokay all right nowwhen you have a set that only hasfinitely manyelements then it's very easy to justwrite them out well i shouldn't say veryeasy what if there's a million elementsthen it would not be easy to write itoutbut in theory you could right and youwould call that a finite set if there'sfinitely many elements okaylet me introduce a word for you heredefinitionthe cardinalityof a setis a measureofhow many elementsor in the setokaylook at how i wrote that i didn't justsay the cardinality of a setis how many elements are in the set isaid it is ameasure of how many elements and that'sbecauseif there's finitely many elements thenit's reallyeasy you just count them and see howmany there areand that's the cardinality of the setokaybut if there's infinitely many elementsthen it gets quite trickyand we'll deal with that later onokay so here's what we're going to usefor cardinalityis vertical bars so i'm going to writethis herevertical bars with the a in there thatlooks like absolute value of aright but here's how i know it's notabsolute valuebecause a is not a number absolute valueis something that you put around anumberokay since a is not a number then thatmust not meanabsolute value what is a it's a setso i know that those bars meancardinalityokay and in this case here thecardinality of ais five because there's 5 elementsin a okayyou can certainly have a set withnothing in itlet's do this definitioni mean why not why does a set have tohave something in itcan't i have a cardboard box withnothing in itand if a set is just like a cardboardbox with you know you see what's inthere to see the elementsif i look in the box and it's empty theni have an empty box right there'snothing wrong with thatso it's the same way with setsa set well actually i should saythe setwith noelementsis called well let me ask youwhat would you call a box with nothingin it you would call it empty wouldn'tyouan empty box sothe set with no elements is called theempty setokay here's what it looks likethat's what it looks like that's theempty set it's a setyou see the curly brackets that meansit's a setwhat's in the curly brackets nothingthey're emptyso it is an empty set okaynow there's a symbol for empty set justlike there's a symbol for pithat iscircle with a line through it ori mean i'm not going to object if youdrawa zero with a line through it that'salsoconsidered a correct symbol for theempty set i just don't like it as muchi like the circle with the line throughitwe all need to get into why that is okayit's just personal preferenceall right let's see here what else i'mgoing to shrink this down so we can seeeverything at once hereokay so we have set an elementnotice i didn't write definition on thatfirst sentence that's because those areusually considered undefined terms kindof likein geometry the words pointand line are considered undefined termsright so in set theorythe words set and element are consideredundefined they're just common notionsthat we agree upon the meaning butwe don't actually say definitionokay all right and then we definedcardinality we defined empty setokay let's definesome of the major sets that you've seenbefore in yourmathematical journeyokay so we have let'slet's label this some importantcents okayso you have the natural numbersand the natural numbers are wholenumbersstarting with onei'll just put an ellipsis there at theend okayso that's the natural numbersthen you have the integerswhich is the natural numbersalong with zeroalong with the oppositesof all the natural numbers so that wouldlook like thisi'll write in order here even though itold you order doesn't matter but it'sstill niceso i'll write it like this the oppositeof five the opposite of fourthe opposite of three the opposite oftwothe opposite of one 01 2 3 45 and so onthose are called the integers okayand it's common to use what's calledblackboard bold lettersfor these sets the natural numbersis usually written with a capital n likethisis how most people write itin booksyou know i don't really know exactly whythis is but in booksthe double stroke is usually on thediagonal line so in booksit's always typed like thathere but when people write it by handthey almost always write it that wayokayso that's natural numbers the integersis called with a capital z and that'sjust because the german word forintegersstarts with a z sothat's how you write integers okay sothese arenaturalnumbersand these are integers and i'll justpoint out for youthat the set of natural numbersis also the set of positive integersnoticethat okay nowthose sets are infinite right there'sinfinitely many elementsso number one if i asked you for thecardinality of thatwell again we would have to talk aboutthat in more detail and we'll get tothat later so let's not worry about itright nowokaynow even though there's infinitely manyof those it's still easy for meto um indicatethe sets right by just using theellipsis you know what that is ellipsisit's those three dotseven though i'm not writing out everyevery number and in fact i couldn'twrite them allout it would take me longer than mylifetimebut it's still easy for me to indicatewhat thisthe sets look like okay now let's go alittle bit furtherwhat about rational numbersokay well let me go ahead and first tellyou the letter for that the letters areqagain um we can thank the germans forthatand people usually write theirblackboard queuesblackboard bold queue like thatokay this is the rational numbersi'm sure you know what rational numbersarethey're fractions right or morespecificallywe say they arenumbers that can be writtenas a ratio of integersso how many are there there's infinitelymanycorrect buti would have a hard time indicating allof them right likeif i wanted to do this with an ellipsislike i did with the natural numbers andthe integershow would i do that i mean i suppose icould saya half a third a fourthand so on right whoops what happenedthere[Music]but that's not going to that's not goingto be good enough is it because even ido thati still have not evennot even scraped the top of the icebergright there's so many morerational numbers than there are integersor are there well i don't know we'regoing to have to discuss that later inthe semesterbut i can definitely tell you that i'mhaving a hard time figuring out a way towrite downall of the rational numbers in there orto write downyou know something that would indicateall of themso i'm going to show you a new trickwhen there'sjust too many things to write down in asetwe use what's called set buildernotationokay and i think the best way to do thisis for me to just write itand then point out the different partsfor you okayso here's here's what i would writethere's a couple of ways of writing itokayi'm gonna write it my way and then i'llalso write it the way that it isin the book so here's what i would writefor rational numberswhat do they all look like they all looklikeinteger over integer right except thebottom integer can't be zeroso i can write this mover n okayand theni'm going to put a colon herenice big colon okay and then i'm goingto saym comma nthis fancy little symbol that looks kindof like an eintegers ohand also that n can't be zero rightokay let's look at that what do youthink this thingmeans it looks like an e doesn't it havewe defined any wordsso far that start with an eoh there's one right there elements wellguess whatthat symbol is the symbol foris or in this case r since it's pluralthere's twonumbers there are elements ofokay i should go up i'm going to scrollup thereand we're going to write that down nextto the definition of elementokay i'm going to write xand then this thing it also looks kindof like an epsilon doesn't itbut it's technically not an epsilonokay so that meansx is anelementof the set aokay so let's go back down to where iwrote this and let'sdissect what i wrote so let me read thisfor youi'm going to highlight as i go from leftto right and i'll say the wordsthat go along with the symbols okay soit says qequalsthe setof mover nsuch that that's what that colon standsforsuch thatm and n are elements of the integersand then the rest is easy and n does notequal zerookay so i'm going to say it again all atonce nowq equals the set of m overn such that mand n are elements of the integersand n is not zero okaynow that colon that means such thati find a lot of students oh iaccidentally erased our queuei find a lot of students don't like thatcolon and preferinsteada vertical bar you can do either oneright here either a colon or a verticalbar but either way it stands for thephrasesuch that only inthis this is called i should write thisdownwhen you do this kind of notation herethis is calledset buildernotationand when you're doing set buildernotationthat vertical bar or colon whichever youpreferstands for the phrase such that but it'sthe only timethat a vertical bar or a colon meanssuchthat outside of set builder notationyou do not use a vertical bar or a colonfor the phrasesuch that okaynow in the book it's written slightlydifferently i personally thinkit isa bit overkill but this is how it is inthe book i'll just show youit says the set of allx such thatx equals m over nwhere mand n are integersand n is not zero so look at what iwrote in gray and what i had previouslywrote in blackyou i hope you can agree that that saysthe same thingi think the way it's written in black ismore efficient and more conciseokay but if you like the way it is ingray better that's fineokay i'm going to erase it for nowso you see let'slet's summarize an empty setis called the empty set and that's howyou write iteither the circle with the with the linethrough it thereor[Music]literally a set with nothing in it okaya finite set is easy to writebecause you can just list the elementsout and put the brackets around themokay or you can give it a nameinfinite sets tend to be harder to writebecause there's infinitely many thingsbut if it's not too complicated you canuse anellipsis or in the case of the integersi needed two ellipsisor ellipsis i don't knowokay and then if it gets morecomplicated than that then you can tryset builder notation[Music]okay now here's another one what aboutthe set of real numbersso that one we call with a blackboardboldr and i'm not even going to bothertrying to write that in set buildernotation okay it's justi mean what would i write the only thingi could think of would be to writeit's the set of all x such thatx is a real number but clearly that'snot going tosuffice because then i'm just using it'scircular right i'm just using the realnumbers to define the real numbersso so real numbers is reallyum it's really almost like anundefined term itself just like the wordsetokay it's just a common notion that wekind of have to agree onyou can define the real numbers and giveit an actual definitionand if you take real analysis you'llprobably do thatbut for right now we're just going totake it as an under understoodconcept okayall right there's also complex numbersby the wayand we're not going to worry about thatright now but here's the symbol forcomplex numbersbut i'm going to erase that i don't wantto leave that on the screenokaylet me think ofwhere we are and what we still need tocoverwell what about intervals we should talkabout intervals you've used those a lotin previous classesso let's scroll up here okayand let's write intervalsokay sowhat kinds of intervals have you seen inpreviousmath classes you've seen ones like thisthat's what we call a closed intervalrightand you've seen ones like this which iscalled openand you've seen intervals that look likethisand ones that look like thisthose are all finite intervalsokay a closed intervalan open interval and then two that areneitherokay but they're all four finiteand then what aboutinfinite intervals you can havesomething like thisand something like thisyou can have something likethis orthis rightand i can think of one more and thisone's not listedin the bookit's kind of surprising because it'svery simple and that's this intervalokay so let's write down all of those inset builder notationin order to give them an actualdefinitionokay so the first one what we call theclosed interval from a to bwhat is that if i ask you what what isthat you would probably say all thenumbers between a and bincluding a and b right buthow about let's write that usingmathematicallanguage and symbols okay so here's howi would write that first onei would write that thing equalsthe setof all x's in the real numberssuch thatx is equal to or greater than a andless than or equal to b see i'm usingset builder notation to give anactual definition for the closedintervalfrom a to b okayand then for the open interval it wouldlook the same except without the equalsso i would say the set of allx in the real numberssuch that x is greater than aand less than bthe next one would bethe set of all x and the real numberssuch that x is equal to or greater thana and less than bso go ahead and think about how youwould write the remainingwell let's leave the last one by itselffor now let's just say the next fivehow would you write those oh and i see iaccidentally repeated myself down therewhere i meant to put aparenthesis okay so take a minute andwrite oror at least just imagine in your headhow would you write the next fiveintervalswith set builder notation i'm going topause for a second and then i'm going tojust write them all outand then you can think about what youwroteor what you pictured in your headsee if you agree with the way i'mwritingokayall right now what about the last onewell the last one is very very differentisn't it the last one is actuallythe set of all real numbersokay so now you have actual definitionforfor these intervals all rightwe're just about donelet's see where we are on time it's been35 minutesi think we're going to stop here okaysome of the lectures will be longermany of them will be longer let me saybut this is just the first lectureand i just want you to get comfortablewith the symbols and the wordsinvolved in writing sets and elementsand especially set builder notation okayand we will continue from here in thenext lecture

Video script okay lecture two we're going to talkmore aboutfinite cardinalities what did i say lasttime does cardinality meani said it's a measurement of how manyitems are in the set right i should sayelements not items how manyelements are in the set rightso you might say you just count how manythings are in the set and that's thecardinalityand that is completely trueunless there's infinitely many things inthe setthen it gets a little bit morecomplicated and we're going toignore that complication today we'reonly doing finitecardinalities okayso that means you can look at the setand simply counthow many things are there and that wouldbe the cardinalityof the set okay solet me do this we'll just start offreally simplelet's look at that set okay and i wantto know the cardinality of thatremember the symbol we're going to usefor cardinalityis identical to the absolute valuesymbolsso i could do that and what would be theanswerhow many things are in that set i seefiveso that's the answer okay another way todo itjust so that you knowis i could have given that set a nameand said a equals thatand then i could have written thecardinality of aequals five okayall right let's go back to the way itwasnow it's a pretty simple concept i thinkright do you agreebut there are some uh smalltechnicalitiesthat are very very commonfor confusing people at first it's veryeasyto get past this confusion and then itwill probably never confuse you againokay but but probably the first time itwilland all we need to do is just point outthe possible confusion andget you past it once and then it'll befine okaylook at thisi'm going to take a setokay and inside of that seti'm going to put a setthat has let's say the numbersone half my pins not working what'sgoing on heregive me one secondyeah that fixed it okay let's say onehalf andfive andpi how about thatso i have a set and inside that setis another set that has three elementsso i ask you this question what is thecardinality of thatthink about for a second okayand i'm going to tell you the answer andyou either got it right or you got itwrongand it's one of these two answers i knowitand the answer is oneokay some of you said threeand that's perfectly fine to say thatbut it's not correctthe answer is one okay let me show youthe reason why i'm going to draw apicture hereremember the analogy i said in the lastlecture because this analogy will helpyou on almost every singleproblem about cardinalities okay andthat is what is a setand what are elements think of a set asa cardboard boxand the elements are the things that yousee when you look into the boxokay listen very carefully what i said ididn'tsay the elements are the things in thebox although that would be truebut that's not the way i said it is it isaid the elements are the things thatyou seewhen you look into the box okay so let'slook at the firstproblemthis this set right hereokay so so what is that it's a cardboardboxokay and inside that cardboard boxare five blocks like the kindyou probably had when you were a kidone of them's got the number five on ithere to save time this is gonna take usall day so to save time i'm just gonnadrawa square okay that's athere's a little block with a five on itand there's a block in there with athree on itand there's a sevenand an eightand a nineokay so when i open that box and i lookinsidehow many things do i see when i lookdown in that boxi see five things right and that's whythe cardinalitywas five okay so that one is notever cause anybody any confusion for themost partokay now let's do the next one and let'ssee where that answer is oneso what i have here is i havea big cardboard boxokay there's a big cardboard boxand i'm asking how many things do yousee in that boxokay so what's in that boxin that box is a cardboard boxlet me erase these dash lines i thinkwe're going to have too manylines in the picture oh i don't want todo it that far hang onokay there we gookay inside that box is anothercardboard boxyou see how i'm making these boxesclosed i'm doing that on purposeit's like they're taped closed okayand inside that little box are threenumbersthere's a block with a one-half and ablock with a fiveand a block with a pieokay nowi open the big boxand i look to see how many things do iseethere it is again remember i'm notsaying how many things are in there i'msaying how many things do you seeso look at that picture if you look downin that box how many things would youseenow mind you this is made out ofcardboard not plexiglas you can't seethroughthe cardboard so when you look insidethat big box what are you going to seeyou're going to see a cardboard boxthat's closed i drew it that way onpurposeright are you going to see the one halfand the five and the pieno because they're inside of another boxand you can't see through that you'renot superman or wonder womanokay so how many things do you see whenyou look in there you see oneand so the cardinality of that set isone because that's how many things yousee when you look in thereokay now the cardinality ofthis setthat's inside of the other setokay the set inside has a cardinality ofthreebecause if you opened that little boxand looked inside you would seethree things so the cardinality of thelittle set is three and then that littlesetis inside of the bigger setand that little set is the only thing inthe big setso the cardinality of the big set is oneokay i hope that makes sense if itdoesn't you can ask me during one of thediscussionsbut usually the box analogy is somethingthat will help youthrough any difficulty of cardinality aslong as there's notinfinitely many elementsokay all right let me erase that pictureso let's just do a few more nowwhat if i did something like thishere's a set that hasinside of it the number 10and a flowerand a set containing the numbers one andtwoand that's allwhat is the cardinality of that setyou haven't the answer is threei would see three things when i peerdown into that boxi would see a number 10 i would see aflower and i would see another boxhere's the other box right there wellhere let me do it like thisso um so there's the number 10 that iwould seeand i would see a flower and i would seeanother boxso i see three things i don't see theone and the twowhen i look inside the big set becausethe one and the two are insideofsomething else okayit's not that hard right it's prettystraightforwardall right let's talk about the empty setdo you remember what that is that'sexactly what the name says it's an emptysetwhat's the cardinality of thatthat's not a trick question it's zerothe cardinality of the empty setis zero because you don't see anythingin itbecause there is nothing in it okaybut don't get that confused with this ohi see i erased that too from thatearlier problem there we godon't get that confused with this here'sa problem thatwe like to ask that it alwaysconfuses people the very first time butthen againas soon as you see oh i understand nowthe mistake then it'll neverbother you again okay so um because iscrolled offof the screen i'm going to just writeagain herethis is what the empty set isand the cardinality is zero okaynow look at this setis there anything in that setand if so or if not what's thecardinality of that setthink about itnow again there's only two answers thatanybody ever says for thisand one of them's right and the otherone's wrongokay here's the correct answerlet me up here let me write thecardinality of the empty set for you thecardinality of the empty set is zerookay the cardinality of this setis one because there's something inthereyou know what's in that set the emptyset is in that setit wouldn't make sense would it if i didthisi'm going to take an empty boxthat's the empty setthere's nothing in there that's theempty set and its cardinality is zerookay and that's whywe get that up there okay but nowwhat does this say this saysit doesn't say the empty set that'swhat's important it says a setwith the empty set inside of it somy claim is that that set's not emptyso let's take that empty box that i drewdown there and now i'm going to put thatempty boxinside of a bigger boxtape it shut okay and then i'm going toask you to open that boxand see if there's anything in itso let's open that boxokay and let's say you look insideis there anything in there you see ifyou said no this big box is empty then iwould sayoh you better go to your optometristbecause when i look in that box i veryclearly see that there's something inthere isn't therethis box is inside thereso you can't say that the cardinalityof this set is zero because that set'snot emptythe cardinality ofthis set is zero that's the empty setokay but thisset is not the empty setthat set has one thinginside of it so the cardinality of thatset is oneokay you see how that worksit's not confusing it's just that almosteverybody will say the wrong answerfirst but then as soon as they realizethen then they got it straight it's notthe sort of thing that keeps causingproblems over and over againokay let's do onejust a final practice on thislet me write a set that has inside of itum let's say oneand the setcontaining two and threeand the set containingfour andthe set containing fiveand the empty set inside of thereokay so let me i'm going to ask youseveral questions about thisokaythere's a set right there the empty setwhat's the cardinality of thatit's zero right cardinality of the emptyset is zerookay now let me ask you a new questionhere's another setwhat's the cardinality of thatokay i hope you say it's two becausethat's correctthat set has a five and the empty setare the elementsokay so that cardinality is twonow here's a bigger setwhat's the cardinality of that carefuldon't be too quick to answerokay carefullyyou know how many things i see in therei see a four that's one thingand i also see this seti see two things in there not threejust two because when i look in this setthat i've underlined in red here when ilook in thati don't see that five and that empty setbecause they're inside ofa smaller box i can't see through thecardboard of that smaller boxokay do you see what i'm sayingall right let's move overhere's another set herethat one's a little bit easier what'sthe cardinality of thatthat's twois that a set no that's not a set isthere's no curly bracketsall right now final question and this isthe big onewhat's the cardinality of that sethere well let's seehow many things do we see let's countthemi'll circle them in purple there's onething that i seehere's anotherand here's anotherhow many things do i see i see threethe cardinality is three by the wayyou might notice this look you can alsouse the commas to help youcount that there's two commas so thatmeans how many things are beingseparatedthree things and why would i not countthis comma because that belongs tothese brackets you seeso that's not a comma for the big setthat's a comma for that smaller setyou see what i'm saying same thing herei wouldn't count this commabecause it belongs inside of thesebrackets so that's for the smaller setand i wouldn't count this comma becausethatis for this set the only commas for thebig setare the ones i circled in redand there's two of them two commas meansthree elements okayall right now i just want to do a littlebit of practice withset builder notation we went over thatin lecture onewhat if i what if i wrote thisthe set of all xin the integerssuch thatx sorry x squaredis between ten and a hundredand the question i want to ask iswhat's the cardinality of that setokay so i'll give you some advice howaboutif we just rewrite that setby listing the elements because i don'tthink there's going to be all that manyso that set would really just be whatlet's see2 squared is 4 so that's not going to bein thereum 3 squared is 9 so that's not going tobe in there4 squared is 16 that'll be in there5 squared is 25 that's between 10 and100what else will be in there 6 will be inthere because 6 squared is 367 and 8 and 9 will be in therebut 10 won't be there because 10 squaredis notless than 100 so that's the whole setright thereand we are being asked for thecardinality of that setso it's actually a very easy questionwhen you write it that waythen the answer is 6 isn't itokay so that's cardinality for finitesets it's a counting problem there's nota lot of really advancedmathematics involved here it's just amatter of understandinghow to count things that you see insideof a boxand you know especially just gettingover that hurdle ofsets inside of sets and how thatis treated when you're trying to findthe cardinalityokayso that's all for today it's a shortlecture todayokay and next time we're going to moveon and we're going to do somethingcalledthe cartesian product sounds a littlebit moretechnical but it's not going to be thathard i don't thinkyou actually to be honest with you youare very very familiar with cartesianproduct alreadyyou just have possibly not been used tousing that namebut you actually already know what itmeans all right that's for next timeso if you have any questions about thiscome to the zoom discussion and ask thequestion and i'll be happy tohelp you through it again

Video script a setis a collection of objects we callelements that could meanphysical objects thoughts ideasand concepts including mathematicalobjects which will of course be the mainfocusfor us possibly more importantly a setis a way of packaging up objectswhich share similar properties in ameaningful wayconsider the set of triangles we canunambiguously state whether somethingis or isn't in this set this is inso is this but this shape isn'tit's not a triangle this lack ofambiguity in what is or what isn't in asetis foundational to set theory we canalso make claims about the set andassessagain without ambiguity whether they'retrue or falseit's true that an element of the set oftriangles has three sidesbut it's not true that the sum of theinternal anglesis 360 degreesa set containing the numbers 1 2 and 3would be written like this with curlybrackets and the elements separated bycommaswe can name the set in this case if wesay a is equal to the set1 2 and 3 we can just refer to the setas awhich is much easier than saying the setcontaining 1 2 and 3again and again to express symbolicallythat an element belongs to a setwe use this symbol for exampleif a is the set containing 1 2 and 3then1 is in a and 2 is in a but 4 is not inaand we use the symbol for in but with aline through it to denote not in[Music]in most cases we don't write out all theelements in a setbut we'll write a shorthand descriptionusing something called set buildernotationfor example the set of prime numberscould be written as capital pis the set of little p such that littlep is primehere the little p is a variable whichmust satisfy some criterion we call thepredicatesince its belonging to the set ispredicated on this criterionin this case the predicate is being aprime number also notice we have ashorthand for the phrase such thatwhich is this vertical line it's goodpracticewhen dealing with sets of numbers todeclare explicitly which sets youstarting withthis is done before the such that symbolfor examplep in the natural numbers such that p isless than fiveis a completely different set to r inthe real numberssuch that r is less than five two setsare equal if they both contain the sameelementsif for all little and capital a little ais also in band for all little b in capital b littleb is also in capital athen the sets a and b are equalthis definition means that the order ofthe elements doesn't matterwe only need to show that they share thesame elementsso if a contains one two and three and bcontains two three and one we say one isin a and it's also in b2 is in a and it's also in b and 3 is ina and it's also in bwe then do the same for all the elementsin band so we've shown that a is equal to bit also doesn't matter if the elementsare repeatedlike before as long as every element inone set can be shown to also be in theotherwe still have equality generally we justwrite the elementsin a way that's easiest to read whichusually means without repetitionsand often in some sensible order butjust to be clear it makes no differenceto the setjust to use as readers the size orcardinality of a set is the number ofelements it containsso if a contains one two and three thenthe cardinality of a is threeand we denote the cardinality of a setwith two vertical linesif a set has an infinite number ofelements like the set of prime numbersfor examplethen it's perfectly fine to write theinfinity symbol as the cardinality ofthe seta set is a subset of another if all ofits elements are also elementsof another set for exampleif a is the set containing 2 4 and 6and b is the set containing 1 2 3 4 5and 6then since the elements 2 4 and 6 whichare in aare also in b then a is a subset of band we use this symbol to denote a beinga subset of bif b equals the set little b in thenatural numberssuch that b is even which of these aresubsets of ba for b the set containing10 100 and a thousand orc the set containing a such that a isequal to 2kwhere k is in the natural numbers well 4is an element of b but not a subsetit's really easy to get mixed up betweenelements and subsetsbut a clue is that the word subsetcontains the word setand subsets are always sets themselvesthe set containing10 100 and 1 000 is a subset of bbecause these are all even numbers thesetof a such that a is equal to 2k where kis in the natural numbersis actually another way of writing theeven numberssince 2 times any number is even and sothis is equal to b but all the elementsof this setare also in b so technically it is asubset of bthis highlights a general property aboutsubsetsall sets are subsets of themselves wecan also take this further to givea different definition of set equalityif a is a subset of b and b is a subsetof athen a is equal to b this is essentiallyreframing the earlier definition of setequalitythat all the elements in one must alsobe in the otherbut in the language of subsets if a is asubset of bbut a is not equal to b then we call a aproper subset of bthis of course implies there areelements in b that are not in aotherwise they'd be equal in sometextbooks aproper subset is denoted like this butsometimes the same symbolis used for subsets that might be equalso you need to infer from context whichthey meansome textbooks use this symbol forproper subsetswhich is more explicit about them notbeing equala really nice and intuitive property ofsubsetsis that if a is a subset of b and b is asubset of cthen a is a subset of c it's prettysimple to prove but probablybest illustrated visually if all of theelements in aare in b and all of the elements in bare in cthen all of the elements in a are in cthis property shows up a lot in sets ofnumbersfor example all odd numbers are integersand allintegers are rational so we can be surethat allodd numbers are rationalthe empty set is a set which contains noelementsit's a special set we give its ownsymbol and it has its own propertiesfirstly the empty set is a subset of anysetlet a be a set since the empty set hasno elementsall the elements in the empty set mustalso be an atherefore the empty set is a subset of athe second property of the empty setis that it's unique let empty set oneand empty set two be two empty setssince the empty set is a subset of allsets we alreadycan deduce that empty set 1 is a subsetof empty set 2and empty set 2 is a subset of empty set1.this is the definition of equality wesaw earlierif empty sets 1 and 2 are equal thenwe only really had a single unique emptyset to begin withand so we can drop the subscripts oneand two and just call them the empty settwo sets may share some elements weindicate the elements in common to bothsetsusing the overlap of two circles inwhat's known as a venn diagramthe union and the intersection are twoways of combining the elements in twosetsinto a new set the union of two sets aand bis a set containing all of the elementsin aas well as all of the elements in b wewrite this formallyas a union b where the large u shapesymbolizes the union is the set x suchthatx is in a or x is in bthe word or is the most important bithere this is liketaking all of the elements indicated inthis shaded area of the venn diagramand notice that it includes elements inboth a and bthe intersection of the sets a and b isa set containing elements that are inboth aand b the intersection of a and bor a intersect b for short is symbolizedwith an upside down union symbol and isformally definedas x such that x is in a andx is in b the word and being the mostimportant bitif the elements of the intersection mustbe in both aand b then we're talking about theoverlapping part of the venn diagramlet a be the set containing zero and oneand b be the set containing one two andthreewhat is the union of a and b and what istheintersection of a and bthe union of a and b contains all theelements in aso zero and one as well as everything inbwhich is one two and three so alltogether and ignoring the repeating onewe have the union of a and b is the setcontaining0 1 2 and 3. remember just to be clearwe get a set containing 0 1 2 and 3 fromtaking the unionnot just the elements 0 1 2 and 3.the intersection of a and b will containonly elements in both aand b in this case only 1 is common toboth a and band so the intersection of a and b isthe set containingone let's do a second example let abe the set of little a in the naturalnumbers such that little a is oddthe odd numbers for short and b be theset of even natural numberswhat is a union b and what is aintersect bthe union of a and b will be a set thatcontainsall the odd numbers and all the evennumberswhich is the set of all natural numbersthe intersection of a and b wouldcontain only numbers that are bothodd and even there aren't any numberswhich fit this criterion and sothe intersection of a and b is just theempty setlet's look at some properties of theunion firstly the union of any set awith the empty set is just a since theempty set has no elementswe have a similar situation with takingthe union of any set awith itself which just gives a if a is asubset of b then the union of a and bis just b because all of the elements inaare already in b and so we don't addanything new to the unionanother example is that the union of aand b is the same thingas taking the union of b with a thefinal property of unionsis if we have three sets a b and c wecan exchange the order we take the unionby moving the brackets and we'll stillget the same outcomeon the left hand side we take the unionof b with cfirst and then take the union with a weend withall the elements in a as well as allthose in band c taking the right hand side westart with the union of a and band then take the union of that with cand just as before we get all theelements fromall three sets this rule actuallygeneralizes to any number of setsand you can take the union in any orderyou likesome properties of the intersection nowremember this is all the elements commonto both setsfirstly for any set a the intersectionofa with the empty set is just the emptysetsince the empty set has no elements itcan't have any elements in common withany other setthe intersection of any set with itselfis just itselfif you remember this is exactly the sameas with unionsif a is a subset of b then theintersectionof a and b is just a the small set ofthe twoas indicated by the shaded area this isbecause the elements in aare also in b and just like with theuniona intersect b is the same as bintersect a that is the order of thesets doesn't makeany difference to the intersection againlike with the unionthe fact that the order doesn't matterextends to three or more sets withbracketswe can see that b intersects c thenthe intersection of the result of thatwith ais the same as taking the intersectionof a and band then the intersection of that with cin both cases we end up with a setcontaining the elements found ina and b and c the shaded area in themiddlelet's look at the cardinality of theunion and intersectionof two sets because there's a usefulidentitylet a be the set containing one two andthree and bbe the set containing three and four wecan see that a contains three elementsand b contains two elements and theunion of a and bwould contain one two three and four andso has a cardinality of fourthe intersection of a and b containsonly threeand so has a cardinality of one nownotice that the two on the left addedtogetherequals the two on the right this isn'tcoincident but it's always truethe identity is usually written as thecardinality of the union of a and bis equal to the cardinality of a plusthe cardinality of bminus the cardinality of theintersectionof a and b also because we're takingaway the cardinality ofa intersect b we can also write this asan inequalitya union b is less than or equal to thecardinality of aplus the cardinality of b we also have acouple of identitiesinvolving both unions and intersectionsfor three setsa b and c taking the union of a with theintersection of b and cis the same as if we take the union of aand band the union of a and c separatelyand then taking the intersection thislooks a lot like multiplying out thebracketsso it's relatively easy to remember buthow do you remember which orderthe union and intersection signs come inluckilyyou don't need to this is because theidentity works if we exchange the unionsfor intersectionsand the intersections for unions herethe intersection of awith the union of b and c is the sameas the union of a intersect b with aintersect cas we've already discussed theseidentities are similar to multiplyingout the bracketsand this kind of property in general isknown as distributivityor the distributive property you mightbe thinking at this pointhow are these identities useful so i'mwhat they calla fair weather cyclist i only cycle inthe summeror in the winter when it's warmer than20 degrees celsiuslet's make sets of these potential daysi could ride a bikewe have summer winter and those that aremore than 20 degrees c the shaded areais therefore the days that i can cycleand we could write this as the unionof summer and the intersection of winterwith days warmer than 20 degreeswe can use the distributive propertywe've just seento work with the logic of a givenstatement so if we have the set of daysin the summeror winter and more than 20 degrees theidentitysays that this must be the same assummer or winterand summer are more than 20 degreeswhich at first sight doesn't seem tomake much sensebut notice that summer or winter isanytimeand summer or more than 20 degrees isthe dayswhen i cycle we're ignoring otherseasons in this exampleand we're taking the intersection ofthese so we getsomething like i cycle any day of theyear but only when it's summer or morethan 20 degreeswhich actually makes sense and isanother way of saying the originalstatementbut what makes this more satisfying isthat we've come to it from a settheoretic identitywhich shows how we might use set theoryto manipulatelogical statements now consider thestatement i only wearwhite or blue shirts here we have threesetsshirts blue clothes and white clothesand forspecifically blue and white shirts wetake the intersectionof the union of blue and white clotheswith shirtsand so the formula might look somethinglike thislike before we can use the distributiverule to play around with the logicso shirts and blue or white becomesblue shirts or white shirts this can nowbe interpreted as i only wear blueshirts or white shirtsit doesn't feel too different to theoriginal statement but againit's quite satisfying that it comesstraight out of the set theoretic rulesbut before we move on from unions andintersectionsi want to show you how we canmathematically prove a statement such asthis oneremember how earlier we showed that if ais a subset of band if b is a subset of a then a isequal to bwell here we can use that exact methodto prove this equationwe'll show first that a union bintersect cis a subset of a union b intercept witha union cand that a union b intersected witha union c is a subset of a union bintersect cwhich implies they're equal to oneanother first suppose we have an elementx which is in a union b intersect cwell it's either in a or it's in bintersectc which would mean it's in both b and cin either casex is in both a union b anda union c because if it's in a this istrueand if it's in b it's also in c so it'sstill trueso this means that a union b intersect cthe thing we started with is a subset ofa union bintersected with a union c since we'veshown any elementof the left hand side is an element ofthe right hand sidenow suppose x is in a union b intersectwith a union c this means that x is inboth a union band a union c if x is not in a then itmust be in both band c so it must be in the intersectionof b and cand otherwise x is in a so x is inthe union of a and b intersect cwhich means a union b insect a union cis a subset of a union being sectc altogether we've shown that a union binsect cis a subset of a union b insect with aunion cand that a union b intersect witha union c is a subset of a union binsectc which proves they're equalthe set theoretic difference of two setsa and bis a set of all elements in a thataren't in bit's usually denoted by a backslash andcan be thought of as like subtracting bfrom a i'll call it a minus b for therest of the videobut remember this is just to make thingseasier to say for exampleif a equals a set containing 1 2 3 4 and5and b is the set containing 2 4 6 and 8then a minus b is the set containing onethree and fivesince we've removed the two and the fourthat were in bb minus a is six and eightsince we've again removed two and fourif b is a subset of a the set theoreticdifference of aand b is called the complement of b withrespect to ait's usually denoted with a superscriptc above the subsetb or as c with b in brackets like afunctionwhy is this important enough to give itits own name well it's kind of like abackgroundto be the things outside of b in generalit's elements not in the set we'reinterested in but not totally irrelevanthere is where we introduce the universalset the universal set uis a set of all elements that arerelevant for some given topic ofinterestif our set a isn't the subset ofsomething specificwe usually assume the complement to a isthe universalset and what that universal set isdepends on contextthis quote from the foundations ofmathematics by stuart and tall sums itup nicelyin the discussion about dogs whenthinking about all non-sheep dogsit's pointless to worry about camelsimagine we're throwing two dice let a bethe number of outcomesof rolling a pair of dice in which bothdies show the samenumber a sensible universal set in thiscase would be the set of all possibleoutcomes of rolling two diceand the complement of a would be theoutcomes where each die shows adifferent number[Music]here are some other examples ofcomplements the complement of the set ofodd numbersis the even numbers and the complementof the rational numbersis the set of irrational numbers noticewith the complement we often getsomething that feels like the oppositeof the original set and that's becausethe complementnegates the predicate with our setbuilder notation we have a set awhich contains all x from sunset bsuch that it fulfills some predicate pwell the complement ofa the things not in a must by definitionnot satisfy p so the complement of a isthe elements x in bsuch that p isn't true and we have thissymbol before pto say it's not true for example if a isthe set of animals that are dogsthen the complement of hay is animalsthat aren't dogslet a and b be subsets of the universalset ubecause nothing is in the empty set itscomplementis u similarly the complement of u whichcontains everything is the empty sethere's an interesting one the complementof the complementof a set returns the original set that'sbecause taking the complement ofa leaves all the things in u but not inataking the complement again we can seethat all that's left in ubut not in our current set is aif a is a subset of b then thecomplement of bis a subset of the complement of a it'seasy to show visuallywhy this is true since everything in ais also in bthere are things in b that aren't in ai'm assuming that they're not equal herethat means that these elements that areinb but not in a will turn up in thecomplement of abut not the complement of b and so weend up with the complement ofa containing everything in thecomplement of band more we now have the famous demorgan's lawsfirst the complement of a union b is acomplementintersect b complement and second thecomplement of aintersect b is a complement union bcomplement let me show you some examplesso you can see what's going on herelet u be the set of all animals and leta be the set of dogs and bbe the set of cats the de morgan's lawssay that the complimentof dogs union cats is equal to dog'scomplimentintersect cat's compliments animals thatare neither dogs nor catsare not dogs and are not cats you cansee that this makes sense logicallyto illustrate the second law if u is theset of natural numberslet a be the set of prime numbers and bbe the set of x in the natural numberssuch that x is less than 100. using thede morgan's lawwe get that the complement of prime andless than 100is equal to the complement of primenumbers arethe complement of less than a hundredremember the complement is like changingtrue to not trueand so we get the set of numbers thatare not primeand less than a hundred is the set ofnumbers thatare either not prime or greater than 100notice that we're allowing numbersgreater than 100but only those that are not primewe've had a few examples so far ofidentities which still workwhen we switch the intersections andunions this is a general rulethat always works and is called the demorgan duality principlegiven any set theoretic identityinvolving the union and the intersectionif the union and intersection areinterchanged throughoutthen the result will be another valididentity so for all of these identitiesyou've seen so far that they come inpairs you'll be happy to know that youcan just remember one of themand exchange the union and theintersections to get a second onethe elements of a set may be setsthemselvesif we have this set a then the setcontaining 0is an element of a but not zero on itsownsince the elements of a are all setshere it becomestricky to keep track of what's anelement and what's a subsetthe set containing zero isn't a subsetof a it's an element as we've seenalreadyin fact the set containing the setcontaining zerois a subset of a and it's important toreally think about the difference incases like thisthe power set is a common thing toencounter and it contains all subsets ofa given setso let a be a set the power set of ap brackets a contains all sets xsuch that x is a subset of a so fora equals the set containing 0 and 1 thepower set of awould contain the empty set a selfthe set containing zero and the setcontaining onewe also have what are called indexedfamilies of setsessentially each element which is a setitselfis indexed by a number and usuallywritten as a subscriptso a being a sub i for i in the set onetwo threeis saying that a contains three sets a1a2and a3 and in some cases it might beeasier to read if we package things uplike thisif a is the set containing set 0 set 0and 1and set 0 1 and 2 we can write this asa1 a2 and a3 where a1 is the setcontaining 0a2 is a set containing 0 and 1and a3 is the set containing 0 1and 2.imagine a set containing everythingeverything in the universeeverything you can imagine all thecombined knowledge of everyone on earthand more we'll call this set omegabecause omega contains everythingand it itself is something then we havethis interesting property thatomega contains itself this leads to akind ofinfinite regress of omegas within omegasto avoid this we might change thedefinition of omega and let omega be theset containingall sets that do not contain themselvesnowassume omega isn't a member of itself bydefinitionthen it must contain itself if it doescontain itselfwell it can't contain itself this isknown as russell's paradoxin fact this is less a problem with howwe've built the set andmore a problem of how we define what asetis in the first place naive set theoryin generaldoes not give any guidance on whatconstitutes a setmostly we don't need to worry about thisbut as you've seen it can lead toproblemsaxiomatic set theory aims to navigatethe paradoxes of naive set theory byprovidinga rigorous definition of what a set isin the form of a list of axiomsstatements something must satisfy inorder to be upsetthanks for watching i'll see you nexttime

Video script Hello Students! I'm Dr Gajendra Purohit and you're watching my youtube channel where I upload videos on Engg mathematics & BScIf you're preparing for any competitive exam where higher mathematics is asked then my youtube channel will be very helpfulClick on the i tab to watch my videosOn high demand I'm here with real analysisToday I'm starting with a very basic concept that is set theory and then we'll look at complex topicsAll the concepts that are usually asked in IIT JAM, CSIR NET , BSc and GATEAlso there's my new channel where I upload videos on IIT JAM, CSIR NET and GATE, so click on the i tab to watch that channelOnce I complete the concepts here, you'll be getting the questions on that channelCardinal number is the number of elements in a set The cardinality of natural numbers is infinite which is denoted as the real and complex numbers have uncountable elementswhich we'll be discussing in the upcoming classesfinite set is a set that has finite elements or finite cardinality infinite set is a set that has infinite elements or infinite cardinality In this example, B is a subset of A to calculate the number of elements in a set  is to take 2 to the power the number of elements in the setthis set will not be a proper subset of A because B should not be equal to Aa and b will be the proper subset of Athe number of subsets are known as power set of Aevery element of A must have a unique image of Bthis should not be a case where 1 element has 2 imagesno element should be left without any imagein a function no element must be left without image in set A and the cardinality of set A must be equal or less than set Bin a one one function, every element of set A must have a unique image in set Bin a one one function, every element of set A must have a unique image in set Blet's look at it with the help of an exampleit also depends on the domain and co domain of the functionsince every element of set A has a image in set B that is one-one functionbut it'll not be a onto function because set B has a element left without a pre image in set Athis function will be one one as well onto  because the every element of set B has a pre image in set Athe easiest way to understand the onto is with a graph Foe eg when we take y=x we get a graphif I draw any line parallel to x-axis it should cut the graph at at least one pointso the function becomes ontolet's take another example i.e. e to the power x which is onto because if I draw any line parallel to x-axis it should cut the graph at at least one pointFor eg - this function will be one one when the cardinality of set A = 3the cardinality of set B = 4now this function can be one one because the cardinality of set A is less than the cardinality of set Bbasically the cardinality of set A should be less than or equal to the cardinality of set B, so the function will be one one for it to be an onto function, it's just the opposite here the cardinality of set A should be more than the cardinality of set Bwhen the function is both one one and onto the cardinality of A = cardinality of BAnother name for one one is injective & for onto is surjectivethis is the example of onto functionthis will be onto because every element of set B will have a pre image in set Ahere in set B no image will be left without a pre image in set A so this will be ontoToday I've taught you just the basics and in the upcoming videos I'll be explaining theorems with proofsI'll soon be uploading more such content for you these are my playlists on GATE, IIT JAM, CSIR NET, etc on my new channel these are my playlists on infinite series, real this is my new channel on IIT JAM, GATE, CSIR NET, etcthis is my old channel on higher mathematicslike, share and subscribe and press the bell icon to get notified

Video script This tiny island nation is smaller
than New York City,but it's the wealthiest country in Asiaand one of the richest in the world.Its GDP per capita itself has surpassed
the likes of the UK,the US, France and other
developed countries.Over six decades,Singapore has transformed itself
from a colonial trading portto a buzzing financial center
that's envied the world over.And it's held up as an
example for any countryseeking to grow a robust,
high-tech economy.Its wealth is the product of
decades of planningby a party that's been in power
since independence.So what's Singapore's
formula for success?And as its leadership changes
for the first time in 20 years,can it continue to prosper?When Singapore became
independent in 1965,the first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew,
and other founding leadersrecognized it had an economic problem:It had no natural resources.So if they wanted to develop an export-led economyand attract foreign capital,they would need to build up the
country's manufacturing industry.Its location gave it an edge.It has access to the Strait of Malacca,
to the Indian Ocean,to the South China Sea,
which makes it a pivotal shipping hub.So it did this initially by transforming
Singapore into a manufacturing basewith a focus on labor-intensive industry at firstto wipe out the high unemployment.But Lee only ever intended manufacturingas a stepping stone
to a more developed economy.He laid the fundamentals,
which is a solid financialand legal system, stable
and largely clean government,making sure that the public transport
system is efficient, has world-class health care infrastructure.In the 1980s,Lee started laying the groundwork
for what is nowSingapore's biggest source of wealth, finance.Following the lead of places
like the US and UK,he liberalized the financial services
industry with lighter touch regulation.The legacy of that approach is evident today.4200 multinational companies
have regional headquarters here.Low taxes are a big reason for that.Singapore's corporate tax rate is just 17%and can hit 13.5% or
lower for some activities.That's also because Lee's successor,
Goh Chok Tong,continued to lean
into attracting big business.Singapore shifted emphasis
to a knowledge-based economythat relies more on creativity
and growing Singapore's entrepreneurs.In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, 
Lee Kuan Yew's eldest son, took over the premiership.And he realized to retain the flow of businesses and wealth,it needed to be an even more attractive place to live in.With its prime location,Singapore had to become a destination in itself.That's been key to Singapore success.It had embarked on an ambitious land
reclamation project in the 1970s.Over the years,that space was filled with not just
offices and apartment buildings,but entertainment hubs, changing
the city skyline in the process.One example was bringing in the F1 night race.The government also welcomed casinos orintegrated resorts,
as they're called in Singapore.And the timing was impeccablebecause the Chinese and Indian
economies were booming.Singapore was ideally situated
to attract the region'sultra-wealthy, who could then
enjoy the casinos and nightlife,but also park their money.The results - the total value of assets
under management in Singaporejumped from $420 billion at the
 start of Lee Hsien Loong’s tenureto 3.6 trillion in 2022.While Singapore has been
an economic success,its leadership is criticized by somefor the restrictions on civil liberties and the media.Freedom of the press,freedom of the news
media must be subordinatedto the overriding needs
of the integrity of Singapore.Under Lee Kuan Yew's governance,one of the chief criticisms is that there was this climate of fear in Singapore.People were afraid to criticize
the government.Subsequent governments also faced
criticism for maintaining a tight grip.Protests are still largely illegal.The government is defiinitely cognizant
that its population is changing.It is much more diverse.It is much more vocal.At the same time,
Singapore needs to stay competitiveas other countries
learn from its model of growth.And climate change is becoming 
a threat to national security.This is the Singapore that Lawrence Wongis inheriting as the country's
new prime minister.Wong, who grew up in public housing,earned praise for his leadershipin the country's COVID-19 response.He is seen as having more of a common man's touch.We should build on what we have today.We should affirm and reinforce
what works well for Singapore.While the People's Action Party
still forms the ruling government,its popularity is declining.There will be that politickingthat will happen much more intenselyin the years to come than
there was ever before.The build-up of wealth
has brought problems of its own.Housing prices have increased.The cost of living has gone up.Part of Singapore's growth
model has been to attract foreign labor.But too much foreign worker
inflow raises concernsby the citizens that the foreigners
are taking too many of the good jobs.If you just look at the numbers,
inequality has been reduced,but that's not how some residents feel.The country's rapidly
aging population is also goingto add pressure to workforce
growth and government spending.So whether it's managing discontentor guiding Singapore's continued
evolution into a tech hub,Wong's job is to sustain
the city-state's hard-earned success.

that's ahuge Topic in of itself so I'm justgoing to touch on a few major pointshere so you get an overallidea after the second world war the USwas the most dominant economic force andthey needed a success story in Asia toprove that capitalism could work outsidethe West so with that in mind they planto turn Japan into a giant of exportsandIndustry in 1949 they set the Japanesecurrency the Yen super low against theUS dollar this would make Japanese Goodscheap for theAmericans Japan's economy was so smallback then that the US could absorb allthe Imports or so the US thought at thetime they were unaware that makingJapanese Goods irresistably cheap wouldbackfire but we'll come back to thatlater trust me it's a realdoozy anyway after the end of theAmerican occupation in 1952 Japanexperienced the period of exponentialgrowth averaging 10% for two decades upuntil the early1970s their costeffective and motivatedWorkforce along with heavyindustrialization policies and the r ofthe ketu system were key drivers thinkof ketu as a club where independentcompanies band together to shareresources and protect themselves fromoutside competition it creates a strongcoopertive

things bureaucracy and lifetimeemployment were no longer sustainablethe rigid structures that had once EdJapan's growth became its shackles I'llgive you one surprising example you'd beshocked to know that Japan which wasonce viewed as the most technologicallyadvanced Nation the country thatproduced the world's AdvancedElectronics was slow to adapt computersin its own offices the excuse for thiswas the complexity of adapting softwareto the Japanese language which hasthousands of characters this is just oneexample of how Japan's rigid systems andbureaucracy ultimately held it back thewhole situation made everyone questionwhat being a Japanese company actuallymeant they had to figure out how to staytrue to themselves while playing byglobalrules the group that suffered the mostwas the younger generation the ones whowere poised to enter the workforce werehit the hardest in many Asian countriesyoung people face immense pressure tobecome contributing members of societyfrom a very early age Japan is noexception to that it often translates toachieving High grades securing a goodjob pursuing higher education and andmaintaining a respectable family life sothink about all the young people whosuddenly saw no future for them thepressure to succeed coupled with a lackof opportunities in the last decadecreated a sense of hopelessness amongthe young the traditional path in

ribs in oneestimation by the cabinet office ofJapan there are63,000 middle-aged and elderly shuttinin the country right now this means thatthey grew up during the last decade alot of them are still living with theiraging parents mostly detached fromsociety between 1991 and 2003 Japan'sGDP growth was only 1.14% the followingdecade from 2000 to 2010 showed asimilar Trend it was just 1% and

success story in Asia toprove that capitalism could work outsidethe West so with that in mind they planto turn Japan into a giant of exportsandIndustry in 1949 they set the Japanesecurrency the Yen super low against theUS dollar this would make Japanese Goodscheap for theAmericans Japan's economy was so smallback then that the US could absorb allthe Imports or so the US thought at thetime they were unaware that makingJapanese Goods irresistably cheap wouldbackfire but we'll come back to thatlater trust me it's a realdoozy anyway after the end of theAmerican occupation in 1952 Japanexperienced the period of exponentialgrowth averaging 10% for two decades upuntil the early1970s their costeffective and motivatedWorkforce along with heavyindustrialization policies and the r

Video script [Music][Applause][Music]ah 1980s Japan Tokyo was growing into asprawling Metropolis reaching upwardsinto the sky and outwards as far as theeye could see if you stepped intoTokyo's fashionable Ginza or rongiDistrict at the time you'd see the placealive with vibrancy and a touch ofMayhem its nightscape was a carnival ofsuccess and ambition bars pubs andnightclubs overflowed with the exuberantthe extravagant and the ecstatic NeonLights flickered like the heartbeat ofJapan's booming economy the party goerscaught in the Head Rush of Japan'spost-war economic miracle through moneylike confetti for them money flowed likesake abundantly and unceasingly and whynot their country had finally made it inthe two decades from 1955 Japan'seconomy exploded by a staggering435 so much so that it's been termed theJapanese Miracle period suddenly andseemingly out of nowhere the islandnation was the most Innovative andproductive country in the world and thesecond largest economy just behind theUS by the 1980s made in Japan no longermeant cheap Novelties now it was a stampof high quality and Innovative productsBrands like Toyota Sony nisson andMitsubishi became household names at thepeak of Japan's economic boom eight ofthe world's largest banks were allJapanese and they held a combined totalof over 2.3 trillion nura Securities hadthe financial resources to purchase allof the major banks on Wall Street by theend of the 1980s Japan's economicprowess had reached dizzying Heightswith soaring stock markets andskyrocketing real estate values Japan'sland at just a fraction of the size ofthe United States was valued at fourtimesmore the Imperial Palace in Tokyo alonewas deemed more valuable than the entireState of California and it wasn't justthe partyo in Tokyo everyone around theworld felt the Japanese Revolution itseemed like the sun would never set onthe Land of the Rising Sun yet almost asquickly as the party started it all cameto a screeching halt on the first day of1990 doubts about the market spread andshare prices started to fall over thenext 2 and 1/2 years they dropped 63%when the 1990s rolled in the economicbubble finally burst the aftermath wasdevastating millions of people losttheir savings and their jobs companiesand Banks went bankrupt it was so so badthat till this day Japan's economy hasnever truly recovered it's beeninfamously stagnant ever since and it'sgiven birth to a period called The Lostdecades birth rates slowed young peoplein Japan aren't getting married andbecause of this their population isaging so what exactly went wrong in thisepisode we'll dive into the excitingroller coaster ride and collapse of thebiggest economic bubble in modernhistory we'll also take a look at itsprofound effects on an entire generationyou are watching P Fusion[Music]TV back in 1960 Ty magazine came outwith a feature Story the cover showcaseda Japanese Phoenix ascending From theAshes In the backdrop of the Phoenixyou'd notice shiny new factories massivevessels and skyscrapers it's quite thesymbolic picture of Japan'sso how do you go from a war ravagedcountry to an economic Powerhouse injust a couple of decades well that's ahuge Topic in of itself so I'm justgoing to touch on a few major pointshere so you get an overallidea after the second world war the USwas the most dominant economic force andthey needed a success story in Asia toprove that capitalism could work outsidethe West so with that in mind they planto turn Japan into a giant of exportsandIndustry in 1949 they set the Japanesecurrency the Yen super low against theUS dollar this would make Japanese Goodscheap for theAmericans Japan's economy was so smallback then that the US could absorb allthe Imports or so the US thought at thetime they were unaware that makingJapanese Goods irresistably cheap wouldbackfire but we'll come back to thatlater trust me it's a realdoozy anyway after the end of theAmerican occupation in 1952 Japanexperienced the period of exponentialgrowth averaging 10% for two decades upuntil the early1970s their costeffective and motivatedWorkforce along with heavyindustrialization policies and the r ofthe ketu system were key drivers thinkof ketu as a club where independentcompanies band together to shareresources and protect themselves fromoutside competition it creates a strongcoopertive relationship it's a bit likea cartel but nicer if one companystruggles others can help them out ifanother company needs expertise otherswill come and lend a hand this systembecame the Cornerstone of Japan'spost-war economy Japan's Central Bankthe bank of Japan also played a hugerole in all of this they had a policycalled window guidance it wasn't ascomplicated as it sounds but basicallythey quietly nudged commercial Banks tolend money into key sectors like shipbuilding electric power coal and steelproduction all of these sectors werevital for Japan's economic developmentby doing this they aimed to get moreinvestment flowing ramp up productionand get the economy bustedironic looking back on it becausenowadays we just print money all rightand finally to tie this all up Japanwent all in on exporting they turned theglobal market into theirplayground the 1964 Tokyo Olympicsprovided the perfect platform tointroduce this new Dynamic resurgentJapan and show it off to the[Music]world the 1980s were undoubtedly thePinnacle of the Japanese economic[Music]by then they'd already establishedthemselves as an economic Powerhousetheir influence was felt in every cornerof the global economy their TradeSurplus was at unparalleled Heightsmultiple times since the1970s after a brief deficit in 1980 dueto the rise in oil prices the country'sSurplus surged to a record-breaking 827billion by1986 now remember when I said the USwould later to regret their decision tohelp Japan well that's starting tohappen now Japan's manufacturers were sosuccessful that they were pouring carsand televisions bikes and cameras intothe UnitedStates with their jobs going Americanswant to strike back America is up inarms Mr speaker and it would be amistake to underestimate ourfrustrations unless this warning is heedretaliation and and possibly full-blowntrade Warfare lie just around the cornerthe United States now had to dosomething to stop Japan from taking overtheworld before Japan's record-breakingTrade Surplus in 1986 a plan was alreadyin place to slow them down in 1985officials from the G5 Nations that isFrance Germany the United States theUnited Kingdom and Japan met at NewYork's Plaza Hotel[Music]Japan finally gave in and agreed to rampup the y valy basically they'reeffectively placing a self-imposedhandicap on its own exporters the coreidea was simple drive up the Yen andlower the dollar this would makeJapanese exports to the US moreexpensive now hold on a second why wouldJapan do something like this in thefirst place this seems like selfsabotage like a sumo wrestler trying totackle themselves out of the ring wellthere were multiple factors Number Oneexternal pressure the Us and othernations were pressuring Japan toappreciate its currency and Shrink itsTrade Surplus they saw it as unfair anddamaging to the global economy Japanagreed to the deal in part to keep itsAlly relationship with the United Statesintact number two internalpressure within Japan Jaan domesticIndustries and consumers were pushingfor a stronger yen to benefit fromreduced import prices that is thestrengthen their currency and make theirimported goods cheaper number threeeconomic strategy there was a beliefthat a robust Yen would spur structuralreforms and innovation in Japanenhancing its economic competitivenessand long-term resilience by 1987 theAccord had achieved its initial goal andthe United States was satisfied with theresult but there was a problem the valueof Japan's currency the Yen surged waymore rapidly than predicted having somany exporting Industries this was ahuge shock to Japan the plaza Accord wasa kind of agreement which accomplishedmuch more than everybody expected forthemeeting when we went to pla meeting weare quite prepared to see substantial uhincrease in Yen's value but the Yen Rosefar faster than anyone expected andJapanese officials grew[Music]alarmed and that was the beginning ofthe end but in many ways however this isalso the point where the real frenzybegan worried about a downturn thepanicked Japanese authorities made afatal mistake they loosened up on creditlimits and cut interest rates down from5% they kept chopping the rates downuntil they were the lowest in the entireworld at the time at 2.5% and they keptit steady there the plan was to boostmanufacturing and increase consumerspending but the money as always endedup somewhere else when money gets cheappeople go crazy with[Music]debt so borrowing money in Japan was nowincredibly cheap now thesystem gave tremendous power to Banksneedless to say because they were theones injecting the capital into thesystem it also gave tremendous power tothe state so the state uh controlled theflow of funds to Banks uh and influencedthe way Banks allocated those fundsinvestors took money from Banks andpoured it into the real estate marketcausing land prices to skyro MarketTokyo was already densely populated andfaced a scarcity of land which onlydrove prices higher the land rush wasn'tlimited to Big investors even farmersand small land owners found themselvessitting on a fortune with 60% ofJapanese owning their own homes peoplefelt wealthier than ever the upwardTrend in land prices quickly spilt overinto the stock market creating afeedback loop of inflated asset valuesbetween 1985 and 1989 stocks and landprices stored by and astonishing 240%and 245 respectively Japanese companiestook advantage of accounting practicesthat allowed them to inflate theirprofits by reflecting the increasingvalue of their land Holdings thisartificial boost in real estate wealthpropped up share prices furtherencouraging speculation companiesweren't content with just owning landmany of them started jumping intospeculation themselves money was nowgrowing on trees it was getting out ofcontrol the frenzy reached such portionsthat many leadingmanufacturers such as the car makerNissan made more money throughspeculative Investments than throughmanufacturingcars among all of these a strange Trendbegan to develop a golf club boom amongthe Japanese top Executives trading agolf club membership worth $3.5 millionwas just another day at the office itsounds insane but these memberships werecoveted assets the whole Market totaledan astonishing $200 billion to put thatinto perspective that sum of tradingGolf Club memberships exceeded taiwan'sentire GDP and came close to matchingSouth Korea's GDP at the time Iliterally laughed when I read that factit was just Bonkers truly an era wherewealth knew no bounds and the smallisland of Japan was now the Pinnacle ofopulence Japanese businessmen trottedaround the globe with a shopping list miishi group grabbed New York'sRockefeller Center and Sony snapped upColumbia pictures in 1986 Japan bought awhopping 75% of the US government bondsfor sale usually a country can't justmake more money and use it to buy thingsfrom other countries but Japan couldbecause the currency dealers didn'tlower the value of Japan's currency ifthe dealers didn't show concern abouttoo much money being made then thecountry can go on printing as much as itcan to buy foreign currency Japan didwhat the US did back in the 1950s and 6s back then US Banks printed a lot ofmoney and American companies used thatfresh cash to buy companies in Europenow the us could do this because theirdollar was tied to

combined_text hi welcome to another episode of ColdFusion2008 was a pretty interesting year itwas my first year of University theiPhone was one year old dubstep wasabout to explode and Breaking Badchanges televisionbut what most people remember from 2008was the financial disaster that camewith it the world would go through oneof the biggest crises it had everwitnessed 19.2 trillion dollars ofhousehold wealth would be lost and someof the biggest financial institutions inthe world would failthe crisis would Mark everyone who livedthrough it without knowing it many havehad their lives determined by thisrecessionfrom the backlash against globalizationto the erosion of trust in governmentfinancial institutions and each other itcan all be traced back to this point intimesince the recession less people arehaving kids and it's been harder to getby and I'm even talking before covertthe 2008 crisis was the death of thereal economy after that point there wasless productivity and more moneyPrinting and low interest rates whichdisproportionately helped the richestpeoplewith the way the global economy islooking today it's increasinglyimportant to look back at this point inhistory to understand exactly whathappened in the parallels it has totodaythis special episode will be split intothree partsfirst I'll take you through the setup ofthe disaster then the crash then thedeath of the real economy and I'llfinish with what you can do to helpyourself let's begin the story of one ofthe biggest events in human historyyou are watching cool Fusion TV[Music]to get the full picture we need to goback to America in 1995.during this year the fight was on tohelp low-income earnersthe US government passed laws todecrease discrimination against poorerhome Borrowersthe banks would lower lendingrequirements offering packages such asreduced payments for a number of yearssoon after in 1999 the U.S governmentrepealed a law that stopped commercialBanks from taking part in InvestmentBanking activitiesthe law that they got rid of was theglass-steagall ACT ironically this lawwas made in 1933 to stop the speculationthat fueled the Great Depression it wasa fatal mistakefrom 1999 onwards Banks which hadpreviously managed conservatively turnedto riskier and riskier Investments aswell as speculation all in an effort toincrease their returnsBanks cared less about their customersand more about Wall Street profitsaccording to Noble economics LaureateJoseph stiglitz this move played a majorrole in the financial collapse that wasto come but why worry right now thingswere good it was the late 1990s andthere were seemingly no economicproblems in sight for America theinternet had taken over the minds ofeveryone investment Banks were throwingmoney behind anything that had a.com atthe endthe result was the launch of stupidcompanies like pets.comthe banks didn't care though when thestock went up they would sell and maketheir profit this was the.com bubble andit had arrived in full force people quittheir jobs to trade stocks and shareswent crazy for example shares ofQualcomm Rose by2619 percent in 1999 alonein America there was money to be madeand life was goodbut something started to happensoon investors realized that theseinternet companies had no cash flow andcouldn't actually make any money and byMarch 2000 it all came crashing downthe next year the September 11th attackswould occur followed by the Enron andWorldcom corporate accounting scandalsafter these events the public and themarkets lost trust in the economyspending trended downwards and it waslooking like the economy was heading fora recessionto avoid this the Central Bank of theUnited States the Federal Reservedecided to lower interest rates down toone percentthe low interest rates would increasespending and recover confidence in theAmerican economywith a low one percent interest rate andno systemic problems in the real economythe recovery was rapid and economicgrowth was ample eventually speculationstarted to migrate from stocks into realestate[Music]by 2003 everyone with a good creditscore and a good job already owned ahome if you were in the business ofgiving out Home Loans this was a badsignto save their profit margins mortgagelenders relaxed credit scores to getmore people in the door and increaseprofits these were called subprime loansas the money flowed in and time went onthe lending standards got lower andlower and lowersoon there were mortgage deals thatrequired no income no job and no assetsso stop checking whether the income waseven real they turned to low and no docloans so-called Liars loans no income nojob no assets and they were stillwilling to lend but help me out here howdoes that make sense for the lender itwould seem to be reckless in the extremeit was but the key assumption was thathome prices would keep going up foreverand in fact home prices Nationwide hadnever declined since the GreatDepression people like acupuncturistRula geosmos became real estatespeculators how many properties did youbuy in this last five year period Ibelieve in the last five year period Ibought about six properties and what didyou buy them for for Investmentsif a subprime customer defaulted it wasno problem just sell the house becauseit was going to go up in value so you'regoing to still make a profit[Music]so this next part is a bit in the weedsbut I need you to bear with me becauseit's crucial to the storyso Wall Street was looking at thissituation and they saw an opportunityyou see there were two groups of peoplethat could be linked here on the oneside were the mortgage lenders who wereprofiting from a newly found Market theywanted to get rid of these risky loansbecause they knew that these loans werejunk and had a huge liabilityon the other hand you had institutionalinvestors who were looking for ways toincrease their returns since interestrates were low at one percent high yieldproducts were off the tablethe Wall Street Banks had an idea andthey got to work offering the perfecthigh yielding product themortgage-backed securitythese were a bundle of individualmortgage debts sold as shares theseshares would give back the investorsthat bought them a safe fixed incomesome rather devious Bankers realizedthat they could use an old Financialtool in combination with mortgage-backedSecurities to make unimaginable amountsof money if they use this tool in thehousing market they could make tens ofbillions of dollars in just months thistool was the CDO collateralized debtobligation to give you an idea of howlovely these products were the bank thatinvented them went bankrupt due to amassive insider trading scandal one wayto imagine a CDO product is to think ofit as a box this box gets filled withmonthly repayments from a group ofmortgages and other debt such as carloans and student loans the Box cangenerate income to investors who buy itit's divided into different levels eachlevel represents a different risk a CDOworks like three cascading traysas money comes in the top tray fillsfirst then spills over into the middleand whatever is left into the bottom themoney comes from homeowners paying offtheir mortgagesif some owners don't pay and default ontheir mortgage less money comes in andthe bottom tray may not get filled thismakes the bottom tray riskier and thetop tray safer to compensate for thehigher risk the bottom tray receives ahigher rate of return while the topreceives a lower but still nice returnthe aim of this was to diversify therisk but there was a fatal flaw sincethe Box had safe Prime Home Loans mixedin with loans to people who had no jobthe whole thing was risky all of therisk was passed to investors whopurchased these debt boxes meanwhile thelenders and the banks profitedhandsomely by charging High fees thissystem was a ticking time bomblenders didn't care anymore aboutwhether a borrower could repay so theystarted making riskier loansthe investment Banks didn't care eitherthe more cdos they sold the higher theirprofitsas the financial assets became morecomplex and harder to Value the majoritydidn't understand how these instrumentsworked they turned to credit ratingagencies for clarity The Hope was thatthese institutions would do theirhomework for them and determine riskcorrectly but as it goes the ratingagencies completely screwed up theyrated these debt boxes as AAA thehighest possible ratingthis signaled that they were extremelysafe good enough for Pension funds andThe Wider economy to invest inbut there's a question remaining why didthe writing agencies rate these debtboxes as high qualitywell sadly it was because the ratingagencies made billions of dollars indoing so if a bank came to them askingto rate their box filled with junk arating agency would know that if theygave the product the true junk ratingthe banks would just go to anotherrating agency down the road to get theAAA rating they desiredrating all of these boxes AAA meant thatthe money kept flowing into the ratingagencies this was another key componentto the disasterthese false ratings would later spreadAmerica's problems to the rest of theworldbetween 2000 and 2007 The subprimeMortgage Debt included in the packagesincreased from 5 to 36 percentthey saw a remarkable success growingfrom an estimated 20 billion in 2004 toover 180 billion in 2007. Bankers werepersonally making millions to tens ofmillions in bonuseswhile this was going on there were somemad scientists in the financial industrythat were creating Financial weapons ofmass destructionthis is where things go insane and thegreed was in full swingthe final stage of the greed was theinvention of the mortgage credit defaultswapthis was a financial instrument thatworked as insurance against failedMortgage Debt productsso it's an insurance contract it is aninsurance contract but they've been verycareful not to call it thatbecause if it were Insurance it would beregulated this is actually the securitythis is the selling document for theSecurities I think anybody ever readthis stuff I doubt very many people readit these complex financial instrumentswere actually designed by mathematiciansand physicists who used algorithms andcomputer models to reconstitute theunreliable loans in ways that weresupposed to eliminate most of the riskobviously they turned out to be wrongwhy because you can't model humanbehavior with math they are complex ineffect mortgage science projects devisedby these Nobel track physicists who cameto work on Wall Street and it didn'tstop Wall Street from making billionsselling them to Banks Pension funds andother institutional investors all overthe world how big is the market forcredit default swaps we really don'tknow there's this voluntary survey thatclaims that the market is in the rangeof 50 to 60 or so trillion dollarssort of alarming that in a market thatbig we don't even know how big it is towithin say 10 trillion dollarsthis enabled Banks to bet on thedirection of a mortgage price if theyguessed right they'll make a bunch ofmoneythink of it for a moment as a footballgame people in the stands may also havea financial stake in the outcome in theform of a bet with a friend or a bookiethe new bet that arose over the lastseveral years is a bet based on whetherpeople will default on their mortgagesand that was the bet that blew up WallStreetand craziest still Banks could bet onthe outcome of the previous bet andBanks could bet on the bed of that betbecause these are swaps and technicallynot Insurance the banks didn't need anycash to back up their bets if they gobad what could possibly go wrong and itused to be illegal it was very illegal100 years ago because it had broughtdown the market in 1907 and they saidwe're not going to let this happen againand then a hundred years later in 2000we rolled them all back in retrospectgiving Wall Street immunity from Stategambling laws and legalizing activitythat had been banned for most of the20th century should have given lawmakerspauseif it sounds meaningless it basically isthese products created no value in theeconomy but we're making Banks a wholebunch of moneyinsurance companies such as AIG sawtheir profits soarFinancial engineering was runningrampant and there was no one supervisingany of these productsin October 2004 the Securities andExchange Commission or SEC bizarrelyrelaxed the liquidity requirements offive banks Goldman Sachs Merrill LynchLehman Brothers bear Stearns and MorganStanley this slit the firethe more the banks borrowed the highertheir Leveragethe SEC somehow decided to letinvestment Banks gamble a lot morethat was nuts I don't know why they didthatfrom 2004 to 2007 these investment Bankseach significantly increased theirfinancial leverage this Amplified gainsbut also Amplified lossesas they gambled more these Banks becameextremely vulnerable to financial shocksin 2007 they reported 4.1 trilliondollars in debt that was about 30percent of U.S GDP at the time the stagewas now fully set for a moment thatwould shake the worldduring 2004 as the U.S economy picked uppace the U.S Central Bank started toincrease interest rates this would setoff a chain reaction event becausefinancial institutions had offered upmany adjustable rate loans based on lowrateshome buyers would enjoy these low ratesfor about two to three years after thisperiod the rates would reset to alignwith the market interest ratebut when you combine Rising rates withlow income subprime customers it was adisaster home buyers went from payinglittle to no monthly interest paymentsto their payments suddenly snapping upto multiple times higher to meet themarketmany just couldn't pay up but after twothree or five years those rates resetthey went up and so did the monthlypayment so a mortgage of say eighthundred dollars a month could easilyjump to fifteen hundred dollarsby mid-2006 an increasing number ofdefaults caused home prices to fallhomes were now worth less than theirmortgage loans many homeowners stoppedpaying their mortgages and went intoforeclosurethis is where the crisis starts gainingmomentum as more foreclosures occurredhome prices fell further while demandkept decreasing as wellas 2007 got underway nearly 1.3 millionproperties were foreclosedthere was a rumbling that something bigwas going on when the subprimespecialist lender near Century Financialfiled for bankruptcy then one subprimelender after another files forbankruptcyby the end of 2007 2.3 million homes hadbeen foreclosed and the subprimemortgage crisis was officially underwaythe high default rates by the homeownersled to a rapid devaluation of thefinancially engineered products frombeforeinvestors were now aware of the

Investments tied toregulation for rating agencies the wholeaim was to stop this kind of disasterfrom ever happening againbut unfortunately it doesn't seem tohave workedtoday banks have reinvented the debtboxes and the tools used to speculate onthem this time they're calling thembespoke collateralized syntheticobligations this time they're usingcorporate debt instead of mortgages2022 saw a large spike in activityquadrupling to 40 billion dollars inthis year alonelet's just hope that corporations don'tall default on their debt due to asystemic shock I personally don't thinkwe'll have another crisis exactly thesame as 2008 but safe to say thesestupid Financial experiments aren'thelping I really sincerely hope thatthere's not more of them out there whichwe just don't know aboutso what happened next what scars didsuch a disaster leave on the economywell there's some strong arguments to bemade that there has been no real economysince 2008.if you look at the GDP per capita of thereal economy of the United States itnever recovered it has been below Trendsince 2008.if you're in your late 30s onwards thisis probably why it felt harder for theaverage person to get ahead since thecrashin the United States alone it'sprojected that an adult that livedthrough the crash has lost about seventythousand dollars in lifetime earningsyounger people were less affected butless employment opportunities still setthem back for the first time a wholegeneration would be poorer than theirparents it's not uncommon for youngerpeople to live paycheck to paycheckfunding their lives would by now paylater debtsubsequently the fertility rates aroundthe world have decreased significantlyafter 2008. there may be otherexplanations for the phenomenon but thecharts are clear a financial disasterwould certainly impact the way familieswould plan for their futureafter the 2008 crisis Central Banksgained more power they set interestrates low for so long that the stockmarket and eventually the wholefinancial system adjusted and settledaround the statelow interest rates meant cheap moneypeople companies and governmentsborrowed money with virtually nointerestInvestments turn risky and excessivedebt distorted many marketsby the mid-2010s these conditions hadbecome the scaffolding for the wholefinancial system growth became dependenton central banks keeping theseconditions the samewealth inequality exploded as thoseclosest to the financial industry gotextremely rich while the rest of thegeneral populace stayed the sameby the late 2010s many economiccommentators were referring to this asthe everything bubblefirst it was stocksthen it was housingthen it's the debt market now whichcontrols everything[Music]this next point is key to reallyunderstanding the death of the realeconomy economic productivity this isthe measure of how much stuff you getout from the resources that you put insince 2008 it's been severely injureddue to zero interest rates for so longafter 2008 the investment that wouldhave gone to productive areas of theeconomy catapulted into riskier sectorsthe real economy just didn't get thecapital it needed to innovate anddevelop and do things more efficientlylow economic productivity affects realwage growth living standards and qualityof lifeeven former Federal Reserve chair JanetYellen called it the quote mostimportant factor determining continuedadvancements in living standardsthis is why when our leaders told usthat the economy was booming in the2010s it really didn't feel like that tomany people productivity was gone it's amissing piece of the 21st centuryeconomic story that's often left outthen we come to 2020 and the pandemicsaw central banks respond much quickerwith a lot of force printing trillionsof dollars as the economy was slowing toa halt there's no denying that thismitigated the pain but was this anoverreaction many think so economicProfessor Jeremy Siegel called it aMonumental mistakeregardless the stock market loved it andvaulted to all-time highsthen investments into risky assets likenfts shot upeventually there was too much money inthe system and not enough goods and theprices of everything started to riseaside from the Fallout of covert and thewar in Ukraine a component of inflationtoday comes from the actions of centralbanksin the later stage of this rollercoaster central banks have panicked atthe large inflation and have startedraising rates this was to slow down theeconomy and reduce demand and this issupposed to bring down inflation but asstated low rates and easy money hadbecome the scaffolding of the financialsystem raising interest rates reversesthese conditions that the financialsystem was used tothis is why as soon as interest ratesstart Rising everything seems to befalling apart stock markets are crashingand companies are laying off staff thewhole system just isn't used to a normalinterest rate environmenttoday there's a lot more debt in thesystem than in 2008 and this was thanksto central banks keeping interest ratesnear zero for more than a decadeincreasing rates would make this largevolume of debt harder to manage forindividuals and governments countrieslike Australia Canada and the UK have alot of variable rate mortgages whichwill snap higher to Market rates overthe next few years subprime car loansand credit card loans are seeingincreased defaults meanwhile CreditSuisse is in trouble and they're sellingpart of their domestic BankCentral Bank liquidity swaps are goingcrazy in Switzerland doubling in thepast couple of weeks it looks like we'regoing to have another recession but whathappens beyond that is anyone's guessafter almost 15 years the 2008 recessionhas taught us several lessons it was theloose lending standards and low CentralBank interest rates that started theproblem Financial engineering spread itto the world bad policy accounting fraudand poor credit rating agencies fan theFlames although structural reform hastaken place since 2008 we should alsotake a deeper look into central banksand their decisions they always seem toprint and leave rates too low for toolong distorting markets and blowing upbubbles only to pop these bubbles laterit's a scenario that seems to be playingout again today all in all the reallesson that we as a society never seemto learn is to keep those in chargeaccountable and also to plan for theunpredictableso for you personally what can you do ifyou're worried and don't trust ourexpert leaders the key is to avoid riskif you are inclined to keep your moneysafe think about assets that have littleto no risk or financial engineeringbehind them some believe physical goldand silver as boring as they may seemare the ultimate riskless assets othersbelieve government bonds are othersstill think plain old cash is best talkto a financial professional to make thatpersonal decision and to sleep easier atnightso before I finally go I do want to hearsome stories from 2008 from

thedeath of the real economy and I'llfinish with what you can do to helpyourself let's begin the story of one ofthe biggest events in human historyyou are watching cool Fusion TV[Music]to get the full picture we need to goback to America in 1995.during this year the fight was on tohelp low-income earnersthe US government passed laws todecrease discrimination against poorerhome Borrowersthe banks would lower lendingrequirements offering packages such asreduced payments for a number of yearssoon after in 1999 the U.S governmentrepealed a law that stopped commercialBanks from taking part in InvestmentBanking activitiesthe law that they got rid of was theglass-steagall ACT ironically this lawwas made in 1933 to stop the speculationthat fueled the Great Depression it wasa fatal mistakefrom 1999 onwards Banks which hadpreviously managed conservatively turnedto riskier and riskier Investments aswell as speculation all in an effort toincrease their returnsBanks cared less about their customersand more about Wall Street profitsaccording to Noble economics LaureateJoseph stiglitz this move played a majorrole in the financial collapse that wasto come but why worry right now thingswere good it was the late 1990s andthere were seemingly no economicproblems in sight for America theinternet had taken over the minds ofeveryone investment Banks were throwingmoney behind anything that had a.com atthe endthe result was the launch of stupidcompanies like pets.comthe banks didn't care though when thestock went up they would sell and maketheir profit this was the.com bubble andit had arrived in full force people quittheir jobs to trade stocks and shareswent crazy for example shares ofQualcomm Rose by2619 percent in 1999 alonein America there was money to be madeand life was goodbut something started to happensoon investors realized that theseinternet companies had no cash flow andcouldn't actually make any money and byMarch 2000 it all came crashing downthe next year the September 11th attackswould occur followed by the Enron andWorldcom corporate accounting scandalsafter these events the public and themarkets lost trust in the economyspending trended downwards and it waslooking like the economy was heading fora recessionto avoid this the Central Bank of theUnited States the Federal Reservedecided to lower interest rates down toone percentthe low interest rates would increasespending and recover confidence in theAmerican economywith a low one percent interest rate andno systemic problems in the real economythe recovery was rapid and economicgrowth was ample eventually speculationstarted to migrate from stocks into realestate[Music]by 2003 everyone with a good creditscore and a good job already owned ahome if you were in the business ofgiving out Home Loans this was a badsignto save their profit margins mortgagelenders relaxed credit scores to getmore people in the door and increaseprofits these were called subprime loansas the money flowed in and time went onthe lending standards got lower andlower and lowersoon there were mortgage deals thatrequired no income no job and no assetsso stop checking whether the income waseven real they turned to low and no docloans so-called Liars loans no income nojob no assets and they were stillwilling to lend but help me out here howdoes that make sense for the lender itwould seem to be reckless in the extremeit was but the key assumption was thathome prices would keep going up foreverand in fact home prices Nationwide hadnever declined since the GreatDepression people like acupuncturistRula geosmos became real estatespeculators how many properties did youbuy in this last five year period Ibelieve in the last five year period Ibought about six properties and what didyou buy them for for Investmentsif a subprime customer defaulted it wasno problem just sell the house becauseit was going to go up in value so you'regoing to still make a profit[Music]so this next part is a bit in the weedsbut I need you to bear with me becauseit's crucial to the storyso Wall Street was looking at thissituation and they saw an opportunityyou see there were two groups of peoplethat could be linked here on the oneside were the mortgage lenders who wereprofiting from a newly found Market theywanted to get rid of these risky loansbecause they knew that these loans werejunk and had a huge liabilityon the other hand you had institutionalinvestors who were looking for ways toincrease their returns since interestrates were low at one percent high yieldproducts were off the tablethe Wall Street Banks had an idea andthey got to work offering the perfecthigh yielding product themortgage-backed securitythese were a bundle of individualmortgage debts sold as shares theseshares would give back the investorsthat bought them a safe fixed incomesome rather devious Bankers realizedthat they could use an old Financialtool in combination with mortgage-backedSecurities to make unimaginable amountsof money if they use this tool in thehousing market they could make tens ofbillions of dollars in just months thistool was the CDO collateralized debtobligation to give you an idea of howlovely these products were the bank thatinvented them went bankrupt due to amassive insider trading scandal one wayto imagine a CDO product is to think ofit as a box this box gets filled withmonthly repayments from a group ofmortgages and other debt such as carloans and student loans the Box cangenerate income to investors who buy itit's divided into different levels eachlevel represents a different risk a CDOworks like three cascading traysas money comes in the top tray fillsfirst then spills over into the middleand whatever is left into the bottom themoney comes from homeowners paying offtheir mortgagesif some owners don't pay and default ontheir mortgage less money comes in andthe bottom tray may not get filled thismakes the bottom tray riskier and thetop tray safer to compensate for thehigher risk the bottom tray receives ahigher rate of return while the topreceives a lower but still nice returnthe aim of this was to diversify therisk but there was a fatal flaw sincethe Box had safe Prime Home Loans mixedin with loans to people who had no jobthe whole thing was risky all of therisk was passed to investors whopurchased these debt boxes meanwhile thelenders and the banks profitedhandsomely by charging High fees thissystem was a ticking time bomblenders didn't care anymore aboutwhether a borrower could repay so theystarted making riskier loansthe investment Banks didn't care eitherthe more cdos they sold the higher theirprofitsas the financial assets became morecomplex and harder to Value the majoritydidn't understand how these instrumentsworked they turned to credit ratingagencies for clarity The Hope was thatthese institutions would do theirhomework for them and determine riskcorrectly but as it goes the ratingagencies completely screwed up theyrated these debt boxes as AAA thehighest possible ratingthis signaled that they were extremelysafe good enough for Pension funds andThe Wider economy to invest inbut there's a question remaining why didthe writing agencies rate these debtboxes as high qualitywell sadly it was because the ratingagencies made billions of dollars indoing so if a bank came to them askingto rate their box filled with junk arating agency would know that if theygave the product the true junk ratingthe banks would just go to anotherrating agency down the road to get theAAA rating they desiredrating all of these boxes AAA meant thatthe money kept flowing into the ratingagencies this was another key componentto the disasterthese false ratings would later spreadAmerica's problems to the rest of theworldbetween 2000 and 2007 The subprimeMortgage Debt included in the packagesincreased from 5 to 36 percentthey saw a remarkable success growingfrom an estimated 20 billion in 2004 toover 180 billion in 2007. Bankers werepersonally making millions to tens ofmillions in bonuseswhile this was going on there were somemad scientists in the financial industrythat were creating Financial weapons ofmass destructionthis is where things go insane and thegreed was in full swingthe final stage of the greed was theinvention of the mortgage credit defaultswapthis was a financial instrument thatworked as insurance against failedMortgage Debt productsso it's an insurance contract it is aninsurance contract but they've been verycareful not to call it thatbecause if it were Insurance it would beregulated this is actually the securitythis is the selling document for theSecurities I think anybody ever readthis stuff I doubt very many people readit these complex financial instrumentswere actually designed by mathematiciansand physicists who used algorithms andcomputer models to reconstitute theunreliable loans in ways that weresupposed to eliminate most of the riskobviously they turned out to be wrongwhy because you can't model humanbehavior with math they are complex ineffect mortgage science projects devisedby these Nobel track physicists who cameto work on Wall Street and it didn'tstop Wall Street from making billionsselling them to Banks Pension funds andother institutional investors all overthe world how big is the market forcredit default swaps we really don'tknow there's this voluntary survey thatclaims that the market is in the rangeof 50 to 60 or so trillion dollarssort of alarming that in a market thatbig we don't even know how big it is towithin say 10 trillion dollarsthis enabled Banks to bet on thedirection of a mortgage price if theyguessed right they'll make a bunch ofmoneythink of it for a moment as a footballgame people in the stands may also havea financial stake in the outcome in theform of a bet with a friend or a bookiethe new bet that arose over the lastseveral years is a bet based on whetherpeople will default on their mortgagesand that was the bet that blew up WallStreetand craziest still Banks could bet onthe outcome of the previous bet andBanks could bet on the bed of that betbecause these are swaps and technicallynot Insurance the banks didn't need anycash to back up their bets if they gobad what could possibly go wrong and itused to be illegal it was very illegal100 years ago because it had broughtdown the market in 1907 and they saidwe're not going to let this happen againand then a hundred years later in 2000we rolled them all back in retrospectgiving Wall Street immunity from Stategambling laws and legalizing activitythat had been banned for most of the20th century should have given lawmakerspauseif it sounds meaningless it basically isthese products created no value in theeconomy but we're making Banks a wholebunch of moneyinsurance companies such as AIG sawtheir profits soarFinancial engineering was runningrampant and there was no one supervisingany of these productsin October 2004 the Securities andExchange Commission or SEC bizarrelyrelaxed the liquidity requirements offive banks Goldman Sachs Merrill LynchLehman Brothers bear Stearns and MorganStanley this slit the firethe more the banks borrowed the highertheir Leveragethe SEC somehow decided to letinvestment Banks gamble a lot morethat was nuts I don't know why they didthatfrom 2004 to 2007 these investment Bankseach significantly increased theirfinancial leverage this Amplified gainsbut also Amplified lossesas they gambled more these Banks becameextremely vulnerable to financial shocksin 2007 they reported 4.1 trilliondollars in debt that was about 30percent of U.S GDP at the time the stagewas now fully set for a moment thatwould shake the worldduring 2004 as the U.S economy picked uppace the U.S Central Bank started toincrease interest rates this would setoff a chain reaction event becausefinancial institutions had offered upmany adjustable rate loans based on lowrateshome buyers would enjoy these low ratesfor about two to three years after thisperiod the rates would reset to alignwith the market interest ratebut when you combine Rising rates withlow income subprime customers it was adisaster home buyers went from payinglittle to no monthly interest paymentsto their payments suddenly snapping upto multiple times higher to meet themarketmany just couldn't pay up but after twothree or five years those rates resetthey went up and so did the monthlypayment so a mortgage of say eighthundred dollars a month could easilyjump to fifteen hundred dollarsby mid-2006 an increasing number ofdefaults caused home prices to fallhomes were now worth less than theirmortgage loans many homeowners stoppedpaying their mortgages and went intoforeclosurethis is where the crisis starts gainingmomentum as more foreclosures occurredhome prices fell further while demandkept decreasing as wellas 2007 got underway nearly 1.3 millionproperties were foreclosedthere was a rumbling that something bigwas going on when the subprimespecialist lender near Century Financialfiled for bankruptcy then one subprimelender after another files forbankruptcyby the end of 2007 2.3 million homes hadbeen foreclosed and the subprimemortgage crisis was officially underwaythe high default rates by the homeownersled to a rapid devaluation of thefinancially engineered products frombeforeinvestors were now aware of the risksand they were now trying to sell thesetoxic debt boxes at all costsin March of 2007 Federal Reservechairman Ben Bernanke tries to calm themarket he States the subprime loan issueis contained he couldn't have been morewrongironically in October 2022 Ben Bernankewould win the Nobel Prize for economicsyou're about to see why this is soironicin August of 2007 a bombshellannouncement rattles the marketFrancis B and P Paribas announces thatthere is no liquidity in the globalmarket for mortgage-backed securitiesin other words nobody wants to buy thedebt boxes anymore they're essentiallyworthless other European Banks followwith similar announcementsthe real picture was becoming clear themortgage-backed Securities that weresupposed to be Triple A and safe are inreality worthless and even worse theyhad spread through the Global Financialsystem undetected like a canceras a result of these shock announcementsthere was a panic among Financial firmsand Banks investors looked around andwanted to pull any funding that wasthought to be vulnerable to mortgagelosses financial institutions struggledto assess the values of their books whatthey thought was worth trillions ofdollars could actually be worth close tozerothe contagion continued to spreadSeptember 2007UK Bank Northern Rock was also playingwith high leverage and financiallyengineered products and they have to bebailed out by the bank of Englandinvestors then queued to take theirmoney outit was the first bank run in the UKsince 1866.while all of this was going on theFederal Reserve was still clueless

Lehman Brothers reported A 2.6billion loss which no amount ofaccounting magic could hide their stockFalls by 73 percentmeanwhile other Banks such as MorganStanley and Goldman Sachs startedbetting

other option wasn't fun eitherthe crash of 1929 and the subsequentGreat Depression lasted for almost adecade there's arguments to be made onboth sidesas for now the crisis was still in fullswing the Federal Reserve also cutinterest rates in the hope of restoringthe market in total during the fourthquarter of 2008 the Central Bank of theUnited States purchased 2.5 trilliondollars of government

Investments tied toregulation for rating agencies the wholeaim was to stop this kind of disasterfrom ever happening againbut unfortunately it doesn't seem tohave workedtoday banks have reinvented the debtboxes and the tools used to speculate onthem this time they're calling thembespoke collateralized syntheticobligations this time they're usingcorporate debt instead of mortgages2022 saw a large spike in activityquadrupling to 40 billion dollars inthis year alonelet's just hope that corporations don'tall default on their debt due to asystemic shock I personally don't thinkwe'll have another crisis exactly thesame as 2008 but safe to say thesestupid Financial experiments aren'thelping I really sincerely hope thatthere's not more of them out there whichwe just don't know aboutso what happened next what scars didsuch a disaster leave on the economywell there's some strong arguments to bemade that there has been no real economysince 2008.if you look at the GDP per capita of thereal economy of the United States itnever recovered it has been below Trendsince 2008.if you're in your late 30s onwards thisis probably why it felt harder for theaverage person to get ahead since thecrashin the United States alone it'sprojected that an adult that livedthrough the crash has lost about seventythousand dollars in lifetime earningsyounger people were less affected butless employment opportunities still setthem back for the first time a wholegeneration would be poorer than theirparents it's not uncommon for youngerpeople to live paycheck to paycheckfunding their lives would by now paylater debtsubsequently the fertility rates aroundthe world have decreased significantlyafter 2008. there may be otherexplanations for the phenomenon but thecharts are clear a financial disasterwould certainly impact the way familieswould plan for their futureafter the 2008 crisis Central Banksgained more power they set interestrates low for so long that the stockmarket and eventually the wholefinancial system adjusted and settledaround the statelow interest rates meant cheap moneypeople companies and governmentsborrowed money with virtually nointerestInvestments turn risky and excessivedebt distorted many marketsby the mid-2010s these conditions hadbecome the scaffolding for the wholefinancial system growth became dependenton central banks keeping theseconditions the samewealth inequality exploded as thoseclosest to the financial industry gotextremely rich while the rest of thegeneral populace stayed the sameby the late 2010s many economiccommentators were referring to this asthe everything bubblefirst it was stocksthen it was housingthen it's the debt market now whichcontrols everything[Music]this next point is key to reallyunderstanding the death of the realeconomy economic productivity this isthe measure of how much stuff you getout from the resources that you put insince 2008 it's been severely injureddue to zero interest rates for so longafter 2008 the investment that wouldhave gone to productive areas of theeconomy catapulted into riskier sectorsthe real economy just didn't get thecapital it needed to innovate anddevelop and do things more efficientlylow economic productivity affects realwage growth living standards and qualityof lifeeven former Federal Reserve chair JanetYellen called it the quote mostimportant factor determining continuedadvancements in living standardsthis is why when our leaders told usthat the economy was booming in the2010s it really didn't feel like that tomany people productivity was gone it's amissing piece of the 21st centuryeconomic story that's often left outthen we come to 2020 and the pandemicsaw central banks respond much quickerwith a lot of force printing trillionsof dollars as the economy was slowing toa halt there's no denying that thismitigated the pain but was this anoverreaction many think so economicProfessor Jeremy Siegel called it aMonumental mistakeregardless the stock market loved it andvaulted to all-time highsthen investments into risky assets likenfts shot upeventually there was too much money inthe system and not enough goods and theprices of everything started to riseaside from the Fallout of covert and thewar in Ukraine a component of inflationtoday comes from the actions of centralbanksin the later stage of this rollercoaster central banks have panicked atthe large inflation and have startedraising rates this was to slow down theeconomy and reduce demand and this issupposed to bring down inflation but asstated low rates and easy money hadbecome the scaffolding of the financialsystem raising interest rates reversesthese conditions that the financialsystem was used tothis is why as soon as interest ratesstart Rising everything seems to befalling apart stock markets are crashingand companies are laying off staff thewhole system just isn't used to a normalinterest rate environmenttoday there's a lot more debt in thesystem than in 2008 and this was thanksto central banks keeping interest ratesnear zero for more than a decadeincreasing rates would make this largevolume of debt harder to manage forindividuals and governments countrieslike Australia Canada and the UK have alot of variable rate mortgages whichwill snap higher to Market rates overthe next few years subprime car loansand credit card loans are seeingincreased defaults meanwhile CreditSuisse is in trouble and they're sellingpart of their domestic BankCentral Bank liquidity swaps are goingcrazy in Switzerland doubling in thepast couple of weeks it looks like we'regoing to have another recession but whathappens beyond that is anyone's guessafter almost 15 years the 2008 recessionhas taught us several lessons it was theloose lending standards and low CentralBank interest rates that started theproblem Financial engineering spread itto the world bad policy accounting fraudand poor credit rating agencies fan theFlames although structural reform hastaken place since 2008 we should alsotake a deeper look into central banksand their decisions they always seem toprint and leave rates too low for toolong distorting markets and blowing upbubbles only to pop these bubbles laterit's a scenario that seems to be playingout again today all in all the reallesson that we as a society never seemto learn is to keep those in chargeaccountable and also to plan for theunpredictableso for you personally what can you do ifyou're worried and don't trust ourexpert leaders the key is to avoid riskif you are inclined to keep your moneysafe think about assets that have littleto no risk or financial engineeringbehind them some believe physical goldand silver as boring as they may seemare the ultimate riskless assets othersbelieve government bonds are othersstill think plain old cash is best talkto a financial professional to make thatpersonal decision and to sleep easier atnightso before I finally go I do want to hearsome stories from 2008 from

combined_text hi welcome to another episode of ColdFusion2008 was a pretty interesting year itwas my first year of University theiPhone was one year old dubstep wasabout to explode and Breaking Badchanges televisionbut what most people remember from 2008was the financial disaster that camewith it the world would go through oneof the biggest crises it had everwitnessed 19.2 trillion dollars ofhousehold wealth would be lost and someof the biggest financial institutions inthe world would failthe crisis would Mark everyone who livedthrough it without knowing it many havehad their lives determined by thisrecessionfrom the backlash against globalizationto the erosion of trust in governmentfinancial institutions and each other itcan all be traced back to this point intimesince the recession less people arehaving kids and it's been harder to getby and I'm even talking before covertthe 2008 crisis was the death of thereal economy after that point there wasless productivity and more moneyPrinting and low interest rates whichdisproportionately helped the richestpeoplewith the way the global economy islooking today it's increasinglyimportant to look back at this point inhistory to understand exactly whathappened in the parallels it has totodaythis special episode will be split intothree partsfirst I'll take you through the setup ofthe disaster then the crash then thedeath of the real economy and I'llfinish with what you can do to helpyourself let's begin the story of one ofthe biggest events in human historyyou are watching cool Fusion TV[Music]to get the full picture we need to goback to America in 1995.during this year the fight was on tohelp low-income earnersthe US government passed laws todecrease discrimination against poorerhome Borrowersthe banks would lower lendingrequirements offering packages such asreduced payments for a number of yearssoon after in 1999 the U.S governmentrepealed a law that stopped commercialBanks from taking part in InvestmentBanking activitiesthe law that they got rid of was theglass-steagall ACT ironically this lawwas made in 1933 to stop the speculationthat fueled the Great Depression it wasa fatal mistakefrom 1999 onwards Banks which hadpreviously managed conservatively turnedto riskier and riskier Investments aswell as speculation all in an effort toincrease their returnsBanks cared less about their customersand more about Wall Street profitsaccording to Noble economics LaureateJoseph stiglitz this move played a majorrole in the financial collapse that wasto come but why worry right now thingswere good it was the late 1990s andthere were seemingly no economicproblems in sight for America theinternet had taken over the minds ofeveryone investment Banks were throwingmoney behind anything that had a.com atthe endthe result was the launch of stupidcompanies like pets.comthe banks didn't care though when thestock went up they would sell and maketheir profit this was the.com bubble andit had arrived in full force people quittheir jobs to trade stocks and shareswent crazy for example shares ofQualcomm Rose by2619 percent in 1999 alonein America there was money to be madeand life was goodbut something started to happensoon investors realized that theseinternet companies had no cash flow andcouldn't actually make any money and byMarch 2000 it all came crashing downthe next year the September 11th attackswould occur followed by the Enron andWorldcom corporate accounting scandalsafter these events the public and themarkets lost trust in the economyspending trended downwards and it waslooking like the economy was heading fora recessionto avoid this the Central Bank of theUnited States the Federal Reservedecided to lower interest rates down toone percentthe low interest rates would increasespending and recover confidence in theAmerican economywith a low one percent interest rate andno systemic problems in the real economythe recovery was rapid and economicgrowth was ample eventually speculationstarted to migrate from stocks into realestate[Music]by 2003 everyone with a good creditscore and a good job already owned ahome if you were in the business ofgiving out Home Loans this was a badsignto save their profit margins mortgagelenders relaxed credit scores to getmore people in the door and increaseprofits these were called subprime loansas the money flowed in and time went onthe lending standards got lower andlower and lowersoon there were mortgage deals thatrequired no income no job and no assetsso stop checking whether the income waseven real they turned to low and no docloans so-called Liars loans no income nojob no assets and they were stillwilling to lend but help me out here howdoes that make sense for the lender itwould seem to be reckless in the extremeit was but the key assumption was thathome prices would keep going up foreverand in fact home prices Nationwide hadnever declined since the GreatDepression people like acupuncturistRula geosmos became real estatespeculators how many properties did youbuy in this last five year period Ibelieve in the last five year period Ibought about six properties and what didyou buy them for for Investmentsif a subprime customer defaulted it wasno problem just sell the house becauseit was going to go up in value so you'regoing to still make a profit[Music]so this next part is a bit in the weedsbut I need you to bear with me becauseit's crucial to the storyso Wall Street was looking at thissituation and they saw an opportunityyou see there were two groups of peoplethat could be linked here on the oneside were the mortgage lenders who wereprofiting from a newly found Market theywanted to get rid of these risky loansbecause they knew that these loans werejunk and had a huge liabilityon the other hand you had institutionalinvestors who were looking for ways toincrease their returns since interestrates were low at one percent high yieldproducts were off the tablethe Wall Street Banks had an idea andthey got to work offering the perfecthigh yielding product themortgage-backed securitythese were a bundle of individualmortgage debts sold as shares theseshares would give back the investorsthat bought them a safe fixed incomesome rather devious Bankers realizedthat they could use an old Financialtool in combination with mortgage-backedSecurities to make unimaginable amountsof money if they use this tool in thehousing market they could make tens ofbillions of dollars in just months thistool was the CDO collateralized debtobligation to give you an idea of howlovely these products were the bank thatinvented them went bankrupt due to amassive insider trading scandal one wayto imagine a CDO product is to think ofit as a box this box gets filled withmonthly repayments from a group ofmortgages and other debt such as carloans and student loans the Box cangenerate income to investors who buy itit's divided into different levels eachlevel represents a different risk a CDOworks like three cascading traysas money comes in the top tray fillsfirst then spills over into the middleand whatever is left into the bottom themoney comes from homeowners paying offtheir mortgagesif some owners don't pay and default ontheir mortgage less money comes in andthe bottom tray may not get filled thismakes the bottom tray riskier and thetop tray safer to compensate for thehigher risk the bottom tray receives ahigher rate of return while the topreceives a lower but still nice returnthe aim of this was to diversify therisk but there was a fatal flaw sincethe Box had safe Prime Home Loans mixedin with loans to people who had no jobthe whole thing was risky all of therisk was passed to investors whopurchased these debt boxes meanwhile thelenders and the banks profitedhandsomely by charging High fees thissystem was a ticking time bomblenders didn't care anymore aboutwhether a borrower could repay so theystarted making riskier loansthe investment Banks didn't care eitherthe more cdos they sold the higher theirprofitsas the financial assets became morecomplex and harder to Value the majoritydidn't understand how these instrumentsworked they turned to credit ratingagencies for clarity The Hope was thatthese institutions would do theirhomework for them and determine riskcorrectly but as it goes the ratingagencies completely screwed up theyrated these debt boxes as AAA thehighest possible ratingthis signaled that they were extremelysafe good enough for Pension funds andThe Wider economy to invest inbut there's a question remaining why didthe writing agencies rate these debtboxes as high qualitywell sadly it was because the ratingagencies made billions of dollars indoing so if a bank came to them askingto rate their box filled with junk arating agency would know that if theygave the product the true junk ratingthe banks would just go to anotherrating agency down the road to get theAAA rating they desiredrating all of these boxes AAA meant thatthe money kept flowing into the ratingagencies this was another key componentto the disasterthese false ratings would later spreadAmerica's problems to the rest of theworldbetween 2000 and 2007 The subprimeMortgage Debt included in the packagesincreased from 5 to 36 percentthey saw a remarkable success growingfrom an estimated 20 billion in 2004 toover 180 billion in 2007. Bankers werepersonally making millions to tens ofmillions in bonuseswhile this was going on there were somemad scientists in the financial industrythat were creating Financial weapons ofmass destructionthis is where things go insane and thegreed was in full swingthe final stage of the greed was theinvention of the mortgage credit defaultswapthis was a financial instrument thatworked as insurance against failedMortgage Debt productsso it's an insurance contract it is aninsurance contract but they've been verycareful not to call it thatbecause if it were Insurance it would beregulated this is actually the securitythis is the selling document for theSecurities I think anybody ever readthis stuff I doubt very many people readit these complex financial instrumentswere actually designed by mathematiciansand physicists who used algorithms andcomputer models to reconstitute theunreliable loans in ways that weresupposed to eliminate most of the riskobviously they turned out to be wrongwhy because you can't model humanbehavior with math they are complex ineffect mortgage science projects devisedby these Nobel track physicists who cameto work on Wall Street and it didn'tstop Wall Street from making billionsselling them to Banks Pension funds andother institutional investors all overthe world how big is the market forcredit default swaps we really don'tknow there's this voluntary survey thatclaims that the market is in the rangeof 50 to 60 or so trillion dollarssort of alarming that in a market thatbig we don't even know how big it is towithin say 10 trillion dollarsthis enabled Banks to bet on thedirection of a mortgage price if theyguessed right they'll make a bunch ofmoneythink of it for a moment as a footballgame people in the stands may also havea financial stake in the outcome in theform of a bet with a friend or a bookiethe new bet that arose over the lastseveral years is a bet based on whetherpeople will default on their mortgagesand that was the bet that blew up WallStreetand craziest still Banks could bet onthe outcome of the previous bet andBanks could bet on the bed of that betbecause these are swaps and technicallynot Insurance the banks didn't need anycash to back up their bets if they gobad what could possibly go wrong and itused to be illegal it was very illegal100 years ago because it had broughtdown the market in 1907 and they saidwe're not going to let this happen againand then a hundred years later in 2000we rolled them all back in retrospectgiving Wall Street immunity from Stategambling laws and legalizing activitythat had been banned for most of the20th century should have given lawmakerspauseif it sounds meaningless it basically isthese products created no value in theeconomy but we're making Banks a wholebunch of moneyinsurance companies such as AIG sawtheir profits soarFinancial engineering was runningrampant and there was no one supervisingany of these productsin October 2004 the Securities andExchange Commission or SEC bizarrelyrelaxed the liquidity requirements offive banks Goldman Sachs Merrill LynchLehman Brothers bear Stearns and MorganStanley this slit the firethe more the banks borrowed the highertheir Leveragethe SEC somehow decided to letinvestment Banks gamble a lot morethat was nuts I don't know why they didthatfrom 2004 to 2007 these investment Bankseach significantly increased theirfinancial leverage this Amplified gainsbut also Amplified lossesas they gambled more these Banks becameextremely vulnerable to financial shocksin 2007 they reported 4.1 trilliondollars in debt that was about 30percent of U.S GDP at the time the stagewas now fully set for a moment thatwould shake the worldduring 2004 as the U.S economy picked uppace the U.S Central Bank started toincrease interest rates this would setoff a chain reaction event becausefinancial institutions had offered upmany adjustable rate loans based on lowrateshome buyers would enjoy these low ratesfor about two to three years after thisperiod the rates would reset to alignwith the market interest ratebut when you combine Rising rates withlow income subprime customers it was adisaster home buyers went from payinglittle to no monthly interest paymentsto their payments suddenly snapping upto multiple times higher to meet themarketmany just couldn't pay up but after twothree or five years those rates resetthey went up and so did the monthlypayment so a mortgage of say eighthundred dollars a month could easilyjump to fifteen hundred dollarsby mid-2006 an increasing number ofdefaults caused home prices to fallhomes were now worth less than theirmortgage loans many homeowners stoppedpaying their mortgages and went intoforeclosurethis is where the crisis starts gainingmomentum as more foreclosures occurredhome prices fell further while demandkept decreasing as wellas 2007 got underway nearly 1.3 millionproperties were foreclosedthere was a rumbling that something bigwas going on when the subprimespecialist lender near Century Financialfiled for bankruptcy then one subprimelender after another files forbankruptcyby the end of 2007 2.3 million homes hadbeen foreclosed and the subprimemortgage crisis was officially underwaythe high default rates by the homeownersled to a rapid devaluation of thefinancially engineered products frombeforeinvestors were now aware of the risksand they were now trying to sell thesetoxic debt boxes at all costsin March of 2007 Federal Reservechairman Ben Bernanke tries to calm themarket he States the subprime loan issueis contained he couldn't have been morewrongironically in October 2022 Ben Bernankewould win the Nobel Prize for economicsyou're about to see why this is soironicin August of 2007 a bombshellannouncement rattles the marketFrancis B and P Paribas announces thatthere is no liquidity in the globalmarket for mortgage-backed securitiesin other words nobody wants to buy thedebt boxes anymore they're essentiallyworthless other European Banks followwith similar announcementsthe real picture was becoming clear themortgage-backed Securities that weresupposed to be Triple A and safe are inreality worthless and even worse theyhad spread through the Global Financialsystem undetected like a canceras a result of these shock announcementsthere was a panic among Financial firmsand Banks investors looked around andwanted to pull any funding that wasthought to be vulnerable to mortgagelosses financial institutions struggledto assess the values of their books whatthey thought was worth trillions ofdollars could actually be worth close tozerothe contagion continued to spreadSeptember 2007UK Bank Northern Rock was also playingwith high leverage and financiallyengineered products and they have to bebailed out by the bank of Englandinvestors then queued to take theirmoney outit was the first bank run in the UKsince 1866.while all of this was going on theFederal Reserve was still clueless

back to 1923 and was the fifthlargest Investment BankThe Firm carried a notional market valueof 13.4 trillion dollarsso how did this number get so highthis was because they were also beingReckless and

stated that LehmanExecutives regularly used accountinggimmicks at the end of each quarter tomake their financials seem less shakythan they really werein reality their risky commercial realestate holdings were 30 times greaterthan their capitalLehman Brothers were so highly leveragedthat a three to five percent decline inreal estate values would completely wipeout all of their capitalby June Lehman Brothers reported A 2.6billion loss which no amount ofaccounting magic could hide their stockFalls by 73 percentmeanwhile other Banks such as MorganStanley and Goldman Sachs startedbetting

Investments tied toregulation for rating agencies the wholeaim was to stop this kind of disasterfrom ever happening againbut unfortunately it doesn't seem tohave workedtoday banks have reinvented the debtboxes and the tools used to speculate onthem this time they're calling thembespoke collateralized syntheticobligations this time they're usingcorporate debt instead of mortgages2022 saw a large spike in activityquadrupling to 40 billion dollars inthis year alonelet's just hope that corporations don'tall default on their debt due to asystemic shock I personally don't thinkwe'll have another crisis exactly thesame as 2008 but safe to say thesestupid Financial experiments aren'thelping I really sincerely hope thatthere's not more of them out there whichwe just don't know aboutso what happened next what scars didsuch a disaster leave on the economywell there's some strong arguments to bemade that there has been no real economysince 2008.if you look at the GDP per capita of thereal economy of the United States itnever recovered it has been below Trendsince 2008.if you're in your late 30s onwards thisis probably why it felt harder for theaverage person to get ahead since thecrashin the United States alone it'sprojected that an adult that livedthrough the crash has lost about seventythousand dollars in lifetime earningsyounger people were less affected butless employment opportunities still setthem back for the first time a wholegeneration would be poorer than theirparents it's not uncommon for youngerpeople to live paycheck to paycheckfunding their lives would by now paylater debtsubsequently the fertility rates aroundthe world have decreased significantlyafter 2008. there may be otherexplanations for the phenomenon but thecharts are clear a financial disasterwould certainly impact the way familieswould plan for their futureafter the 2008 crisis Central Banksgained more power they set interestrates low for so long that the stockmarket and eventually the wholefinancial system adjusted and settledaround the statelow interest rates meant cheap moneypeople companies and governmentsborrowed money with virtually nointerestInvestments turn risky and excessivedebt distorted many marketsby the mid-2010s these conditions hadbecome the scaffolding for the wholefinancial system growth became dependenton central banks keeping theseconditions the samewealth inequality exploded as thoseclosest to the financial industry gotextremely rich while the rest of thegeneral populace stayed the sameby the late 2010s many economiccommentators were referring to this asthe everything bubblefirst it was stocksthen it was housingthen it's the debt market now whichcontrols everything[Music]this next point is key to reallyunderstanding the death of the realeconomy economic productivity this isthe measure of how much stuff you getout from the resources that you put insince 2008 it's been severely injureddue to zero interest rates for so longafter 2008 the investment that wouldhave gone to productive areas of theeconomy catapulted into riskier sectorsthe real economy just didn't get thecapital it needed to innovate anddevelop and do things more efficientlylow economic productivity affects realwage growth living standards and qualityof lifeeven former Federal Reserve chair JanetYellen called it the quote mostimportant factor determining continuedadvancements in living standardsthis is why when our leaders told usthat the economy was booming in the2010s it really didn't feel like that tomany people productivity was gone it's amissing piece of the 21st centuryeconomic story that's often left outthen we come to 2020 and the pandemicsaw central banks respond much quickerwith a lot of force printing trillionsof dollars as the economy was slowing toa halt there's no denying that thismitigated the pain but was this anoverreaction many think so economicProfessor Jeremy Siegel called it aMonumental mistakeregardless the stock market loved it andvaulted to all-time highsthen investments into risky assets likenfts shot upeventually there was too much money inthe system and not enough goods and theprices of everything started to riseaside from the Fallout of covert and thewar in Ukraine a component of inflationtoday comes from the actions of centralbanksin the later stage of this rollercoaster central banks have panicked atthe large inflation and have startedraising rates this was to slow down theeconomy and reduce demand and this issupposed to bring down inflation but asstated low rates and easy money hadbecome the scaffolding of the financialsystem raising interest rates reversesthese conditions that the financialsystem was used tothis is why as soon as interest ratesstart Rising everything seems to befalling apart stock markets are crashingand companies are laying off staff thewhole system just isn't used to a normalinterest rate environmenttoday there's a lot more debt in thesystem than in 2008 and this was thanksto central banks keeping interest ratesnear zero for more than a decadeincreasing rates would make this largevolume of debt harder to manage forindividuals and governments countrieslike Australia Canada and the UK have alot of variable rate mortgages whichwill snap higher to Market rates overthe next few years subprime car loansand credit card loans are seeingincreased defaults meanwhile CreditSuisse is in trouble and they're sellingpart of their domestic BankCentral Bank liquidity swaps are goingcrazy in Switzerland doubling in thepast couple of weeks it looks like we'regoing to have another recession but whathappens beyond that is anyone's guessafter almost 15 years the 2008 recessionhas taught us several lessons it was theloose lending standards and low CentralBank interest rates that started theproblem Financial engineering spread itto the world bad policy accounting fraudand poor credit rating agencies fan theFlames although structural reform hastaken place since 2008 we should alsotake a deeper look into central banksand their decisions they always seem toprint and leave rates too low for toolong distorting markets and blowing upbubbles only to pop these bubbles laterit's a scenario that seems to be playingout again today all in all the reallesson that we as a society never seemto learn is to keep those in chargeaccountable and also to plan for theunpredictableso for you personally what can you do ifyou're worried and don't trust ourexpert leaders the key is to avoid riskif you are inclined to keep your moneysafe think about assets that have littleto no risk or financial engineeringbehind them some believe physical goldand silver as boring as they may seemare the ultimate riskless assets othersbelieve government bonds are othersstill think plain old cash is best talkto a financial professional to make thatpersonal decision and to sleep easier atnightso before I finally go I do want to hearsome stories from 2008 from

combined_text Inside this smartphone are 62 microchips 
containing a total of 90 billion transistors.  These microchips are incredibly powerful and 
the cornerstone of all technology, but how are  billions of nanoscopic transistors manufactured 
into a microchip the size of a tiny ant? Well, all these microchips were manufactured in 
a semiconductor fabrication plant like this one.  Inside it is a clean room which spans the area of 
8 football fields and is filled with hundreds of  machines ranging in size from that of a van to 
that of a city bus and costing anywhere between  a few million and 170 million dollars. Within 
this microchip factory, silicon wafers travel  from machine to machine and undergo around a 
thousand processes over a 3-month period. And,  by the end of production, each silicon wafer 
will be covered in hundreds of CPU chips  each containing 26 billion transistors.
When we zoom in we can see the nanoscopic  transistors at the bottom and over 
a dozen layers of wires above. This  integrated circuit is then cut out from 
the wafer, tested, and packaged so that  it can be installed into your desktop computer.
In this video we’re going to explore the entire  microchip manufacturing process and show 
you how billions of nanoscopic transistors  and an impossibly complex 3D maze of wires 
are manufactured in one of the world’s most  technologically advanced microchip factories. 
It’s an incredibly complicated process,  so stick around and let’s jump right in! A portion 
of this video is sponsored by Brilliant.org. There are two sides to understanding how microchip 
manufacturing works. The first is the sequence of  steps and processes needed to build the nanoscopic 
transistors and the labyrinth of wires. Whereas  the second is how the semiconductor fab and 
multimillion dollar equipment on the cleanroom  floor work, and we’ll be flipping between 
these two sides to get a complete picture. Let’s start by opening up this desktop computer, 
focusing on the CPU and taking a look at what’s  inside. Here we have an integrated circuit, or 
die, which we’ll refer to as a chip. This chip  has 24 cores, a memory controller, a graphics 
processor, and many other sections. Within one  of the cores, we can see its block diagram 
and the various elements. Zooming in on  this multiply block, we find a layout of 44 
thousand transistors that physically execute  32-bit multiplication and constitute just 
point zero zero zero one seven percent of the  overall 26 billion transistors in the CPU.
Zooming in even further, we see layers of  metal wires, or interconnects, and at the very 
bottom are the transistors that form the basic  logic gates. Note that these layers of metal 
interconnects aren’t floating, but rather,  the empty space that you see is filled with 
insulating materials, thus providing structure,  and preventing the metal wire layers from 
touching. Furthermore, here we’re only showing  the transistors at the bottom and five layers of 
metal interconnects with vias traveling vertically  between the layers. In actuality there are a 
total of 17 metal layers of wires in the CPU,  and each successive set of levels uses larger 
and larger interconnects. At the bottom are  local interconnects that move data around this 
32 bit multiply circuit. In the middle are  intermediate interconnects that move data around 
the core, and at the top are global interconnects  that move data around the entire CPU.
You might be wondering how small are  these transistors? Zooming in again and past 
the interconnect layers we find FinFets,  which are transistors whose channel dimensions 
are 36 by 6 by 52 nanometers with a transistor  to transistor pitch of 57 nanometers. Clearly 
the transistors are incredibly small. Here’s  a mitochondria, a dust particle, and 
a human hair for size comparisons. Now that you have a sense of what the transistors 
and labyrinth of metal interconnects look like,  let’s explore how they’re manufactured.
We’ll begin with an analogy. Imagine baking  a cake that’s 80 layers tall, with each layer cut 
to a unique shape. To make this cake there are  940 steps in the recipe, which takes 3 months 
to complete and includes hundreds of exotic  ingredients. And, if any measurement, baking 
time, or temperature is more than one percent off,  then the cake is entirely ruined. That’s 
kind of what it’s like to make a microchip,  but microchips are even more complicated.
Let’s look at a single layer of this integrated  circuit and run through a simplified 
set of steps used to build it. To start,  a layer of insulating silicon dioxide is deposited 
on top of the wafer and then a layer of light  sensitive photoresist is spread across the top. 
Next, using UV Light and a stencil, a pattern is  applied to the photoresist. Solvents then are 
used to remove the areas hit by the UV light,  thus creating a patterned mask layer. Using the 
mask, the revealed silicon dioxide is etched away  down to the previous layer. Next the mask layer is 
removed, and a layer of copper is added to cover  the wafer and fill in the areas that were just 
etched away. Finally, the surface is ground down  and leveled off to reveal the copper and insulator 
patterns. And thus, a single layer is completed. In order to build the next layer, which is 
a vertical set of metal vias, we repeat the  same set of steps, but use a different pattern 
for the photomask. Since these layers are all  built using the same set of steps it’s more 
effective to visualize the steps as a circle  like a clock. To build all the 80 layers of the 
die, this sequence is repeated over and over,  resulting in 940 steps. One important note is 
that the FinFet transistors at the bottom are  even more complicated than the metal wires, and 
thus additional steps are needed to fabricate  them. Furthermore, cleaning the wafer to wash away 
dust particles that may have landed on the wafer,  as well as inspecting the wafer to make 
sure everything is being built properly,  happens frequently and these steps need to 
be added to the circle. A different tool is  used to complete each of these process steps. .
Now that we have an understanding of the steps,  let’s take a look at this semiconductor 
fabrication plant. This CPU is manufactured  on a 300-millimeter silicon wafer which can 
fit 230 CPU chips. In contrast DRAM chips are  considerably smaller and thus 952 of them can fit 
on a wafer. These silicon wafers are carried in  stacks of 25 using a container called a front 
opening universal pod, or foup. This sealed  plastic wafer carrier is transported around the 
cleanroom floor using an overhead transport system  which lowers the foup onto the tool’s landing pad. 
Inside the tool, robotic arms transport the wafer  through vacuum load locks and to different 
process chambers where materials are added,  removed, or processed in ways that we’ll explore 
later. The wafers are then returned to the foup,  resealed inside, lifted up to the overhead 
transport system, and carried to and dropped  onto the next tool, where the next step in the 
process is completed. To build the entire chip  composed of 80 different layers it takes 3 months 
of traveling from tool to tool where at each  stop one of the 940 process steps is completed.
In order to increase the microchip mass production  capabilities of a semiconductor fabrication 
plant or fab, typically there are dozens of the  same semiconductor tools organized in rows that 
perform the same process. On the cleanroom floor  there are a total of 435 semiconductor tools 
resulting in the fab’s production capacity of  50,000 wafers or 11.5 million CPUs a month.
These tools have rather complicated names,  so we’ll start by categorizing them according 
to their functionality. There are 6 groups:  making the mask layer, adding material, 
removing material, modifying the material,  cleaning the wafer, and finally inspecting 
the wafer. We’ve color coded the different  functional groups to the various tools and 
process steps to help you not get lost. Let’s next look at each of these semiconductor 
tools and see how they process the wafer in  various ways. We’ll start with the ones that are 
used to make the mask layer or the nanoscopic  stencil on the wafer. These tools include the 
photoresist spin coater, photolithography tool,  developer and photoresist stripper. First the 
photoresist spin coater applies a light-sensitive  layer to the surface of the wafer and sends 
it through a soft bake where the wafer is  heated in order to evaporate the solvent from 
the photoresist. Next the wafer goes to the  lithography tool which shines UV light through a 
stencil, which is technically called a photomask.  The light passes through the stencil and is then 
demagnified or shrunk down to produce a nanoscopic  pattern on the wafer. Wherever the light from 
the stencil touches the wafer, the photoresist is  weakened. The wafer then goes to the developer 
and the weakened photoresist is washed away,  leaving only the patterned nanoscopic stencil on 
the wafer. The wafer is then sent through a hard  bake to harden the remaining photoresist. 
Next the wafer travels to other tools to  undergo processing, and once these processes 
are completed the wafer goes to a photoresist  stripper which uses solvents to dissolve and 
remove the photoresist mask layer. And that’s  how a mask layer is formed and then removed.
The photolithography tool is one of the most  important, so let’s take a look at it. Inside 
is a UV light source, a set of lenses to  focus the light, a photomask which contains the 
stencil, or design of the layer to be patterned,  and a wafer carrier. The photomask is 6 by 6 
inches, and, based on the dimensions of the CPU,  can fit 2 copies of a single layer of 
the CPU design. The purpose of using  a photomask with these crazy optics is because 
it’s a reliable way to copy and paste a design  for billions of nanoscopic transistors and wires 
onto 230 identical CPUs on a single wafer in a  few minutes. After the light passes through the 
photomask, the UV light goes to more lenses in  order to shrink down the pattern by a factor of 
4 and print a single layer of the design onto the  photoresist. The wafer carrier steps from position 
to position, printing the photomask image at each  stop, until all 230 chips are patterned.
Let’s clarify one detail. In our previous  examples, we talked a lot about this CPU having 80 
layers. Specifically, what we were referring to is  the number of photomasks and mask layers used to 
create all the different layers of patterns on  the wafer. Therefore, one complete CPU chip 
uses 80 different photomasks, each costing  300,000 dollars. With only one mask layer being 
patterned at a time, this CPU chip will undergo 80  separate visits to the lithography tool. We could 
spend another hour talking about photolithography  but let’s move onto the next category of tools.
Deposition tools are used to add or deposit  material onto the wafer. A lot of times we 
use the mask layer from the photolithography  step to add materials to the areas uncovered 
by the mask layer, kind of like spray painting  through a stencil. Due to the wide range of 
elements and compounds used to create the layers,  deposition tools have a wide range of variations 
with complicated names and acronyms for each  variant. But essentially there are 3 key groups 
of materials that are added or deposited onto  the wafer: metals such as copper or tantalum, 
insulators which are typically called oxides,  and crystalline layers of silicon. Each group of 
different materials uses different physics and  chemistry principles to deposit the material 
on the wafer and therefore has a different  technical name for the tool that deposits the 
material. Deposition tools typically have a  central wafer handling chamber, with the various 
chambers attached to the edges, each one dedicated  to adding just a single element or compound.
The next category of machines do the opposite,  which is to remove material. There are 2 
key methods. The first is etching. Etchers  use either corrosive chemicals or high energy 
plasmas to react with and remove materials from  the surface of the wafer. They are typically used 
with the mask layer stencil in order to remove the  material exposed by the mask, thus creating a hole 
that can be later filled by a deposition tool. The second method to remove material is CMP, 
which is chemical mechanical planarization. CMP  applies slurry and uses abrasive pads to grind 
and polish away the top surface of the wafer,  making it perfectly flat. CMP levels off the top 
layers of the wafer and is typically used as the  last step in a cycle of processes in order to 
prepare the wafer for another layer to be added. The fourth category are tools that modify the 
silicon and are called ion implanters. These tools  use the photomask stencil to bombard the unmasked 
regions with phosphor, boron, or other elements  in order to make the P and the N regions required 
to form the transistors themselves. Therefore, ion  implanters are only used in the front end of line. 
You might think that this is adding material.  However, ion implanters only add around one atom 
of phosphor or boron for every 10,000 atoms of  silicon. Additionally, while other machines spray 
paint a layer on top of the wafer, ion implanters  hurl atoms deep into the silicon lattice, kind 
of like a cannon launching a baseball 6 feet into  a concrete wall. This process typically damages 
the silicon lattice, which is why the following  step is to repair the silicon by heating the 
wafer using a separate tool called an annealer. The fifth category of tools are used to clean 
and remove any contaminants or particles from the  wafer. These wafer washers use ultra-pure water to 
clean the wafer and then dry it with nitrogen or  hot isopropyl alcohol. Cleaning the wafer happens 
rather frequently in order to remove any stray  particles that may have fallen onto the wafer.
And finally, sixth are tools that inspect the  transistors and metal layers for defects and 
are called metrology tools. A common metrology  tool uses a scanning electron microscope with 
nanometer-level resolution to take pictures of the  top surface of the wafer and determine if there 
are defects such as improperly patterned layers  or particles on the surface. When fabricating 
an integrated circuit that takes 3 months to  complete, it’s important to repeatedly monitor the 
progress and make sure that each of the processes  is being executed with nanometer-level precision.
Now that we’ve covered each of the categories,  here are the color coded process steps 
along with the layout of the tools in the  semiconductor fabrication plant. Let’s run 
through the complete set of steps used to  manufacture a single metal interconnect layer.
First a layer of insulating silicon dioxide is  deposited onto the wafer. Next photoresist is 
spread across the surface and the wafer is sent  through a soft bake to remove the solvent. The 
wafer then travels to the photolithography tool  where the design from the photomask is transferred 
to each of the chips on the wafer by weakening  the areas of photoresist hit by the light. The 
wafer next goes to the developer to wash away  the sections that were hit by the light from the 
lithography tool and then through a hard bake to  harden the remaining photoresist. With the mask 
layer built, the wafer goes to an etching tool,  where a plasma etcher removes a vertical column 
through the exposed silicon dioxide until it  reaches the previous layer’s metal vias. Next the 
wafer is sent to a photoresist stripper where the  mask layer is removed. The wafer then travels 
to a physical vapor deposition tool where a  sequence of metals fills in the exposed pattern 
and coats the wafer in metal. Finally the wafer  is sent to a chemical mechanical planarization 
tool where the metal is ground down so that all  that remains is a flat layer of insulating silicon 
dioxide and conductive copper interconnects that  match the pattern from the photomask. A single 
metal layer is now completed, and the wafer is  ready for the next cycle to begin where insulating 
silicon dioxide and the vias will be added. Note  that cleaning and wafer metrology or inspection 
steps occur in between many of these other  steps. Furthermore, the process steps to make the 
transistors are less straightforward and utilize  the ion implanter, and thus we’ll cover them in a 
separate video on transistor physics and design. These steps are for building the 
integrated circuit on the wafer, however,  there are additional steps in manufacturing a 
microchip which we’ll explore in a little bit. But before we get there, one important thing 
to note is that the semiconductor industry  is incredibly secretive regarding the exact tool 
layout and the process steps and recipes used to  make the transistors. We wanted to make the best 
video on how microchips are made and it took us  180 hours of scouring the internet and textbooks 
for information and reference images and, using  what we found, we spent 205 hours modeling each 
of these tools, the many layers of the integrated  circuit, and the semiconductor fab. Furthermore, 
writing the script took about 100 hours, and then  animating all these visuals took more than 825 
hours. As a result, this video took over 1300  hours to make, and it’s entirely free to watch. 
We want to make more videos like this one where we  explore computer architecture and how transistors 
work, and we can’t do it without your help. The  best way you can help is by taking a few seconds 
to scroll down, write a comment below, like this  video, subscribe if you haven’t already and then 
share this video on social media or send it to a  friend or colleague. Truly, just a few seconds 
of your time helps far more than you think.  Additionally, we have a Patreon page where 
we’ll be releasing behind the scenes footage  of our work and updates for upcoming 
videos. If you find what we do useful,  we would appreciate any support. Thank you.
So then, what are the additional steps in  manufacturing a microchip? Before 
chip manufacturing at the fab,  we first have to manufacture the silicon 
wafers by refining quartzite into pure silicon,  and then growing a monocrystalline ingot 
and cutting it into wafers. For reference,  these 300-millimeter wafers are around 
three-quarters of a millimeter thick,  they have a barcode on the side and a small 
notch in them to indicate the direction of the  crystal lattice. Furthermore, these wafers are 
incredibly delicate, and shatter into hundreds  of shards when broken. A single wafer costs 
around a hundred dollars, but after being  populated with CPUs it’s worth closer to a hundred 
thousand dollars, making it quite literally ten  times more valuable than its weight in gold.
Moving onto the steps after chip manufacturing.  The completed wafer is sent to a separate building 
where each of the CPUs undergoes rigorous testing  to figure out if it works as intended. If a CPU 
works, that’s great. But frequently a particle  or photomask defect has damaged a section of 
the integrated circuit, rendering that section  defective. These semi-functional circuits are then 
categorized, or binned, based on what still works.  These Intel Thirteenth Gen processors are sold as 
an i9, i7, i5, or i3, depending on how many cores  are functional with different product lines of 
CPUs whose on-board integrated graphics sections  are defective. These wafers are transported 
to another building where the chips are cut  out using a laser, flipped over, and placed on an 
interposer which distributes the connection points  to a printed circuit board while a protective 
heat conductive cover is placed on the back  side. The printed circuit board holds the landing 
grid array that interfaces with the motherboard  as well as various electrical components. Next 
an integrated heat spreader is mounted on top,  and the entire assembly is tested one last time 
before being packaged for sale. Finally, the CPU  is now ready to be mounted onto the motherboard 
and installed into your desktop computer. It’s important to understand that chip 
manufacturing requires an incredible  amount of science and engineering and there’s a
