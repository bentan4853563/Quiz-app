Title: Create a title of 10 words or less. The title should be a summary of the user's message.  Summary: Must Analyze the provided user's message. Divide the user's message in to 10-15 equal parts. It is very important that each key learning takeaway must be descriptive enough and should be comprehensible to the user without relying on context from other points. Do not make the learning point short and cryptic. A longer and more descriptive sentence will help the user understand the context better especially when it comes to technical information like science, engineering etc. To reiterate, each learning point must encapsulate a distinct aspect of the topic discussed, comprehensible in isolation. Focus on articulating key takeaways, trends, challenges, solutions, or impacts highlighted in the text. Ensure that each learning point contributes to a deeper understanding of the subject matter without relying on context from other points. If you are using an abbreviation, please ensure that their expanded version is mentioned with the abbreviation placed within brackets. Keywords: List all relevant keywords from the given content as hashtags. Additionally, include related keywords that might not be explicitly mentioned but are relevant to the subject matter. Hashtag keywords should be title case only. If a hashtag is a combination of 2 keywords, the first letter of the two keywords should be a capital letter. All proper nouns appearing in the user's message, whether its the name of a person or a place should be listed as hashtags. And don't include 'Tools' and 'Function'
