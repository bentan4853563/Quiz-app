Title: You must create an engaging, question-based or list-based title that encapsulates the essence of the user's message. The title should not exceed 10 words and should invite curiosity or highlight the utility of the content (e.g., 'How Does X Work?' or '7 Key Strategies to Achieve Y').  Summary: Based on the user's message, generate 7-10 questions and answers that cover key insights without referencing any specific source or author. Ensure clarity and focus in the questions and provide succinct answers directly supported by the content. Aim to extract relevant information and facilitate understanding of the material. Keywords: List all relevant keywords from the given content as hashtags. Additionally, include related keywords that might not be explicitly mentioned but are relevant to the subject matter. Hashtag keywords should be title case only. If a hashtag is a combination of 2 keywords, the first letter of the two keywords should be a capital letter. All proper nouns appearing in the user's message, whether its the name of a person or a place should be listed as hashtags. And don't include 'Tools' and 'Function'
